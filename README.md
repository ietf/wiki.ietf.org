# README
This repository contains the content of pages from (https://wiki.ietf.org), a community wiki for IETF participants to use.

This wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings. Not all IETF groups have pages on this wiki. The [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org) is the best source of official information.

Changes can be proposed here via pull requests.  Any IETF participant is welcome to edit it. See the [Contributing to this wiki page](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/contributing) for a quick start guide and more details.

Please note the following guidance for submitters:

* Synchronisation and change control:
    * Synchronisation between this repository and the site is bi-directional and triggered every 5 minutes.
    * All suggestions or regular edits of content should be made via Github using pull requests
* Content conventions:
    * Internet-Drafts are referred to as 'Internet-Drafts' or 'I-Ds', never 'drafts'
    * Internal page links use the full title of the page, not any other text.
    * Headings always start at H1 and then to H2 then H3 and so on.
* Markdown dialect:
   *  The pages all have a header table automatically generated by wiki.js.  This should be ignored when editing.
   *  Wiki.js uses the {.tabset} construct which is not recognised by GitHub Flavoured Markdown and so will not render correctly in GitHub previews.
   * [Wiki.js markdown documentation](https://docs.requarks.io/en/editors/markdown) should be consulted for further details

This wiki should not be used for content that should be on any of the other dedicated IETF sites. For example the following are out of scope:
+ Explanatory/general text about the IETF.
+ Repository/listing/metadata for Internet-Drafts and/or RFCs
+ Information for authors of I-Ds.
+ Information about the AUTH48 process
