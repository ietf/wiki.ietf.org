# Remote Hubs for IETF 101
Remote participation is available individually or from a Remote participation Hub. In both cases, please register as a remote participant: https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/register/.

You can host a remote participation hub for a working group session. The requirements are simple:

- You just need a meeting room, a stable Internet connection and a computer (if there are more than 5 participants in your hub, please consider using a projector).
- Look in the meeting agenda for the date and time of the working group session you're interested in: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/101/agenda-utc
- Fill in the form calculating the appropriate time in your location (note that the meeting agenda is in UTC):
- Spread the word about your remote hub using social media, mailing lists, contacts, etc.
