## Discussion Topics
### IRTF Meeting on Internet-Challenges for AI at IETF-125
* CoNEXT workshop in December 2025: https://irtf-net4ai.github.io/inet4ai/
* Paper shared by Dave Oran: https://arxiv.org/html/2508.06394v1

Dirk Kutscher is working on an agenda for a research focused look at AI and what the IRTF should do on this topic. This meeting will allow AI focused side meetings with a research focus to consolidate into one meeting to discuss. He is looking for input on topics to address and involvement. 

Suggestions involved making this meeting less about structured topcis and more exploratory into what topics should be considered for future. 

Another suggestion included breaking up the meeting into two parts: 1. Interactions of internet architecture and AI with the internet below it and 2. The internet is running on AI - AI assisted operations etc. 

Alvaro Retana mentioned what the IESG is working on. Focusing on what is not in scope there is a good path forward - https://github.com/ietf-artarea/bofs/pull/1/changes 

Dirk Kutscher will take all the suggestions and will share a plan with the IRSG for the meeting.



### ANRP selection concluded

Six really good papers will be presented. It will be an interesting program this year. 


### IRTFOPEN@IETF-125

There will be two IRTF OPEN slots, one will be the regular IRTF Open and the other will be Internet-Challanges for AI. Typically we have invited a speaker for the IRTF Open. If you have any suggestions for Shenzhen, please reach out to Dirk Kutscher. 


### Next-Generation Inter-Domain Routing Architecture and Protocols: idrng@irtf.org

* Summary description of the list

Next-Generation Inter-Domain Routing Architecture and Protocols (IDRNG)
The IDRNG mailing list fosters open technical discussions, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among researchers, operators, and protocol designers focused on the advancement of inter-domain routing architectures and protocols in the AI era.

For inquiries, please contact the list owners at: idrng-owner@ietf.org.

* Detailed Explanation of the Purpose of the Mailing List：

The IDRNG mailing list serves as the primary communication platform for discussions on architectural, protocol, manageability, and operational aspects of next-generation inter-domain routing.

Specifically, the IDRNG mailing list aims to:

1.  Foster in-depth technical discussions on the evolution of inter-domain routing architectures and protocols.

2.  Explore AI-driven routing architectures, including the integration of artificial intelligence in routing control, optimization, and decision-making.

3.  Promote collaboration on routing security and assurance mechanisms, such as forwarding-intent expression and verification, anomaly detection, and misconfiguration analysis.

4.  Provide a space to discuss inter-domain routing requirements shaped by AI workloads, including compute–network co-scheduling, latency-sensitive and burst traffic, and energy- or carbon-aware constraints.

5.  Facilitate the exchange of ideas and research on multi-agent and agentic routing models, where autonomous agents representing operators, applications, or AI systems interact, cooperate, or compete across administrative boundaries.

6.  Coordinate the development and evaluation of methodologies, reference scenarios, testbeds, and datasets for next-generation inter-domain routing research, sharing insights gained from emulation, simulation, and experimental deployments.

7.  Support the creation, discussion, and review of research papers and IRTF/IETF documents, including Informational, Experimental, and Best Current Practice (BCP) RFCs.

8.  Serve as a liaison and coordination hub with other IETF and IRTF working and research groups, as well as relevant research, standards, and operational communities.

The mailing list is open to all interested participants and operates in line with IETF and IRTF principles of open participation, technical merit, and consensus-driven discussion.

This is not a research group but a mailing list for discussion. Dirk Kutscher suggested joining the mailing list and providing feedback.
