The WIT area intersects most frequently with Internet area, the applications area, the ART area, the security area and several IRTF research groups. The WIT Area includes what was previously called the "transport area" or "TSV area" - covers a range of technical topics related to data transport in the Internet. 

## Transport Area Review Team (TSVART) 

The [Transport Area Review Team](/group/tsv/TSVART) is an advisory group of transport protocol experts selected by the WIT area directors. The area directors use feedback from the Area Review Team when making decisions on a range of topics related to Internet transport and the related IETF activities. More information about the tasks, members and activities of the TSV area review team can be found on the TSVART page.

## HTTP Directorate (HTTPDIR)

The HTTP Directorate reviews documents for how the HTTP protocol is used, to assure proper interoperation and deployability on HTTP infrastructure, architectural alignment with HTTP, and fture extensibility and evolution of the application and HTTP itself.

## Mailing List and Aliases
The area-wide mailing list of the web and Internet transport area is http://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/wit-area and the mailing list archive is at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/wit-area/.

Several other aliases offer convenient shortcuts to send email to various WIT Area people and community members:

## Office Hours
The WIT area directors try to schedule office hours during each IETF plenary meeting, which allow anyone to drop in to discuss relevant topics. The time and place are usually announced before each meeting.
