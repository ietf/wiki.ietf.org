- # Welcome to the ACE Wiki

## ACE Profile Roadmap

In the ACE WG meeting at IETF #99 it was decided to use the Wiki to make a roadmap for the completion of the authorization-related work, in particular the dependencies between the ACE profiles. 

Instructions for ACE profile authors: Please verify/fill in the details of the profile in the table. Further information can be detailed below. NOTE: This does not have to be a complete description of the profile, but an outline of what is contributed and how it relates to other profiles.

|  Profile name | Use case | Role of Client | Role of RS | C-RS protocol | Com. sec. | Dependency | Implementations | Drafts |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------|

## Background info

Appendix C of the ACE Framework lists the requirements on profiles of this framework which is the basis for the comparison here.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-07#appendix-C

* Profile identifier
* Communication protocol between client and RS 
* Security protocol between client and RS 
* How the client and the RS mutually authenticate?
* Specify the Content-format of the protocol messages 
* Proof-of-possession protocol(s) and which key types (e.g. symmetric/asymmetric) are supported 
* Introspection support, and if so,
   * Communication protocol between RS and AS 
   * Security protocol between RS and AS   
   * How the RS and the AS mutually authenticate?
* Communication protocol between client and AS 
* Security protocol between client and AS   
* How the client and the AS mutually authenticate?
* Does the profile define other methods of token transport than the /authz-info endpoint?

Additional items to compare:

* Use cases
* Existing implementation
* Dependency on other profiles
