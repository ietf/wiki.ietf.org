# BoF Coordination Meetings Guidance

Prior to each plenary meeting, the IESG and IAB convenes to discuss and decide which BOFs should be approved.  These meetings are called the "BoF Coordination Meetings".

## Background on BoFs

* Community Consensus Guidance
  * [Section 2.4 of RFC2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html#section-2.4)/IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures   
  * Considerations for Having a Successful Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Session/[RFC5434](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5434/)
* Other Key Concepts
  * (from RFC2418) Only two BoFs per topic are permitted
  * A BoF can convene as a virtual interim meeting
  * One purpose of a BoF is to provide decision support on whether starting the chartering a WG is appropriate.  A BoF is NOT required to start a WG
  * A BoF can be convened to discuss a topic whose ultimate conclusion would not be forming a WG
  * BoFs are designated as either “non-WG forming” or “WG forming” as an IESG management technique to focus the discussion and set community expectations for the BoF.  This designation is not documented in a community-consensus document or in the Datatracker.  However, it is part of the BoF proposal intake form.
    * A “non-WG forming” BoF is intended for topics in the early stages of discussion where it is premature to discuss matters at the level of specificity of a charter.  This designation is also appropriate for BoF topics whose intent is not to charter a WG.
    * A “WG forming” BoF is intended for more mature topics where discussion of a specific charter is appropriate. A tangible charter is required for such a designation.

## BOF Coordination Meeting Ground Rules

* Decide on whether to convene the BoF  
* Do not hold the BoF during the coordination meeting
* Decisions are made over the course of two BOF coordination meetings – refinement of the BoF proposal between meeting 1 and 2 is possible 

## Meeting \#1

Purpose: Preliminary review of [each BOF request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bof-requests); guide and improve proposals

Attendees: IESG \+ IAB

Outcomes for a proposal:

* Provisional Approval, scheduled for upcoming plenary meeting
* Maybe  
* Defer  
* Delete as spam

Proposals are often grouped into two categories – proposed WGs already in the chartering process and those topics that are seeking a BOF.  The former are typically approved to allow defensive scheduling should the topic either need another BOF (assuming it hasn’t had two meetings already) or so that it could convene as a WG at the upcoming plenary meeting.

For those designated approved or maybe, a responsible AD is assigned

Some changes between WG forming vs. non-WG forming BOF occur.  It is not uncommon to debate whether a BOF is ready to be WG forming.

## Meeting \#2

Purpose: Final decision for the BOFs at the upcoming IETF meeting

Attendees: IESG

Outcomes for a proposal:

* Final Approved, scheduled for upcoming plenary meeting
* Defer
