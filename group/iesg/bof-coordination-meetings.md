# BoF Coordination Meetings Guidance

Prior to each plenary meeting the IESG and IAB convenes to discuss and decide which BOFs should be approved.

## Meeting Ground Rules

* Decide on whether to convene the BoF  
* Do not hold the BoF during the coordination call  
* Decisions made over the course of two BOF coordination meetings – refinement of the proposals is possible  
* When deciding on a BOF, topics get no more that two BOF meetings (per [Section 2.4 of RFC2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html#section-2.4))  
* Typically WG Forming BOFs require the presence of a proposed charter

## Background Reading

* [Section 2.4 of RFC2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html#section-2.4)/IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures   
* Considerations for Having a Successful Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Session/[RFC5434](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5434/)

## Meeting \#1

Purpose: Preliminary review of [each BOF request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bof-requests); guide and improve proposals

Attendees: IESG \+ IAB

Outcomes for a proposal

* Provisional Approval, scheduled for upcoming plenary meeting
* Maybe  
* Defer  
* Delete as spam


Proposals are often grouped into two categories – proposed WGs already in the chartering process and those topics that are seeking a BOF.  The former are typically approved to allow defensive scheduling should the topic either need another BOF (assuming it hasn’t had two meetings already) or so that it could convene at a WG at IETF 122\.

For those designated approved or maybe, a responsible AD is assigned

Some changes between WG forming vs. non-WG forming BOF occur.  It is not uncommon to debate whether a BOF is ready to be WG forming.

## Meeting \#2

Purpose: Final decision for the BOFs at IETF 122

Attendees: IESG

Outcomes for a proposal

* Final Approved, scheduled for IETF 122  
* Defer
