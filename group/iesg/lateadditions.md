# Late Additions to the IESG Agenda

If an AD needs to add a document or WG charter to the telechat agenda after the normal deadline (15:00 ET on the previous Thursday), this can be done in the normal way. The same applies to management items (deadline 13:00 ET Wednesday). However, late additions are to be avoided as much as possible - and the probability of other ADs deferring such items is obviously higher than normal. It wouldn't be a good idea to add a 100 page draft to the agenda on Tuesday evening...

As a courtesy, an AD making a late addition to the agenda, any time after the preliminary agenda has been sent out, should also send a note to the whole IESG warning them of the late addition (and explaining the urgency).

The official version of this is at https://www.ietf.org/IESG/internal/TIMETABLE.txt.
