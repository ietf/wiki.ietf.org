# IESG Balloting FAQ

## What do ADs ballot on?

During the formal telechat, ADs might ballot on:
* documents
* charters
* conflict reviews

## What procedures exist for balloting?

For documents balloting, these procedures are defined in the [IESG Ballot Procedures for Documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-ballot-procedures-for-documents/) statement. 

Guidance on the specific positions taken on charters and conflict reviews is not specifically documented, but derived from the document procedures.

## When have procedures outside of the normal document balloting procedures been invoked?

Per [IESG Ballot Procedures for Documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-ballot-procedures-for-documents/), the IESG can use "normal", "single DISCUSS", and "alternative" balloting procedures.  Since 2015, procedures other than "normal" have been invoked for these documents:

| Date | Document | Balloting Procedure | 
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2017-11 | [draft-wu-l3sm-rfc8049bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wu-l3sm-rfc8049bis/ballot/) | Single DISCUSS |
