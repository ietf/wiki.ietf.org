# Desired Expertise summary to be sent to the NomCom

This is a collection of the summary of desired expertise that we send to the NomCom. Each year, we review them and update as necessary. The NomCom liaison then puts together the appropriate collection of these (e.g., including IETF Chair on those years that it's appropriate, grabs the Management or Operations description as appropriate, etc.) for the NomCom. Checking the history of each page lets you see changes from year to year.

[Generic Expertise](/group/iesg/GenericExpertise) (applicable to all IESG positions)

[IETF Chair Expertise](/group/iesg/ChairExpertise)

[Applications and Real Time (ART) AD Expertise](/group/iesg/ArtExpertise)

[Internet AD Expertise](/group/iesg/InternetExpertise)

[Management AD Expertise](/group/iesg/ManagementExpertise) (Note: Not part of 2020 NomCom cycle)

[Operations AD Expertise](/group/iesg/OperationsExpertise)

[Routing AD Expertise](/group/iesg/RoutingExpertise)

[Transport AD Expertise](/group/iesg/TransportExpertise)

(There are also some older pages [here](/group/iesg/GeneralRequirements) and [here](/group/iesg/AreasDescription), for historical interest).
