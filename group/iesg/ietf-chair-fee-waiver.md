# Background

The IETF Chair is allocated a fixed number of fee waivers for in-person attendance of the IETF plenary meeting.  This fee waiver program covers the meeting attendance fee only – there is no support for travel or related expenses.  This program is distinct from the [remote free waiver program](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/registration-fee-waivers/), [IRTF Fee Waiver Program](https://www.irtf.org/feewaivers.html), and [IRTF Travel Grant](https://www.irtf.org/travelgrants/).  The IETF also offers a substantial discount on the registration fee for full-time students, and a discounted pass for one day attendance.

In 2024, the IETF Chair budget was 10 waivers for each plenary meeting.

# Criteria

The disbursement of the IETF Chair Fee Waiver Program is at the discretion of the IETF Chair.

Currently, priority for the IETF Chair Fee Waiver Program is given to supporting:

* Individuals already active in the IETF (e.g., authors of adopted WG documents, WG chairs, implementers) who have experienced a temporary funding lapse (e.g., loss of employment between plenary meetings, loss of internal support for IETF work for current employer)  
* Individuals in close geographic proximity to the meeting venue  
* Individuals key to supporting an active IETF conversation (e.g., in a WG or BOF)

Due to its limited scope, this fee waiver is not intended to support: 

* Capacity building and onboarding of new IETF participants  
* The same individual in recurring meetings

# Submitting a Request

Requests for waiver can be submitted as soon as the registration opens for a given plenary meeting by sending an email to support@ietf.org. When requesting a fee waiver, please explain why you need a fee waiver, in which WGs/BOFs you will be active, what contribution you will make to the group(s), and which meeting you are requesting a fee waiver for.

Notice of award will come no later than 30 days from the start of the meeting.
