 The IESG has a number of common topics that frequently come up. This is an effort to capture them - along with the last time it came up and whether it was considered resolved.

1.    RFC Process
     a.   Role of the ISE
     b.   Clarifying with the community the differences between RFC Streams 
2.    How to Reduce the Work of the IESG
     a.   Push work to the WG Chairs
     b.   Push work to the document Shepherds
     c.   Get better cross-area review before IESG review 
3.    How to speed up the IETF work?
      a.  Publishing a v0 version of an RFC with danger-only review (do we need new boilerplate for this?) 
4.    What work belongs in the IETF?
