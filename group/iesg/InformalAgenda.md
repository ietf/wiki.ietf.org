## Agenda

### 2. Documents
#### 2.1 draft-yg3bp-ccamp-network-inventory-yang (Rob)
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-yg3bp-ccamp-network-inventory-yang/

Folks want to standardize this in CCAMP (rather than NETMOD, OPSAWG or RTGWG), and I want to check that IESG is aware and okay with this.

### 3. Management Issues
#### 3.1 RFC6761bis (Paul, pushed to Sep 29 due to Warren absense)
#### 3.2 IESG Executive Session Topic #1
