# MPLS WG Document Status
This page shows the status of MPLS WG documents.

## Individual I-Ds the Authors Have Requested for Adoption

The authors have indicated to the chairs that they consider these documents ready for adoption. The chairs will look at these I-Ds, discuss them, and either tell the authors what issues exist or will move the documents to the next status.

| Date | Draft | Remarks | Shepherd  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Queued for WG Adoption Poll

Documents in this state are waiting for the chairs to issue an adoption poll. Adoption polls and working group last calls will be paced by the chairs so that the working group participants are not swamped with review activity.

This is generally a FIFO queue, but special cases may arise and the chairs may issue adoption polls in a different order.

## In Adoption Poll

## Adoption Poll Complete But Pending Author Action

Adoption polls may succeed or fail. In the case of failure, the document moves back to being just another individual I-D. In case of success, the chairs may instruct the authors to re-post the draft as a working group document before addressing the comments received from the working group, but sometimes adoption will be dependent on the authors making specific changes to the document. This state captures such documents.

## Queued for WG Last Call

Documents in this state are waiting for the chairs to issue a working group last call. Adoption polls and working group last calls will be paced by the chairs so that the working group participants are not swamped with review activity.

This is generally a FIFO queue, but special cases may arise and the chairs may issue working group last calls in a different order.

## In Working Group Last Call

| Draft | Date Started | Date Ends | IPR Poll complete? | Shepherd | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Working Group Last Call Completed Pending Action

Working group last calls may succeed or fail. In the case of failure, the document moves back to being just another working group I-D. In case of success, the chairs may instruct the shepherd to product the write-up before they pass the document to the AD requesting publication, but sometimes working group last success will be dependent on the authors making specific changes to the document. This state captures such documents.
