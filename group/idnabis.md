# IDNAbis wiki

There's not much here yet, below you see the original content (setup default). In theory Trac allows to manage **tickets**, a project **roadmap**, this **wiki**, and sources (likely not applicable here, the WG produces Internet-Drafts managed elsewhere). For recent changes wrt Trac check out the **timeline**, this page also offers to subscribe to an atom feed of recent changes.

The WG page on the IETF tools server offers its own feed of recent changes including new drafts. To go to this WG page click on **idnabis** at the top of any Trac page, or remove the .../trac part from any Trac URL below [http://tools.ietf.org/wg/idnabis http://tools.ietf.org/wg/idnabis/trac/...].

Just in case the shorthand `[purlnet:draft/ietf-idnabis-protocol]` links to [purlnet:draft/ietf-idnabis-protocol] (example).
