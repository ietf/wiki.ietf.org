## Getting Started as an AD
- An IESG Charter, RFC 3710 (2004)

There is a lot of useful information on how to utilize the tools. As a new AD you will work with the Secretariat for access.

[Reference for All ADs](/group/iesg/newADinfo) on subjects such as basic AD responsibilities, using the datatracker, the document ballot process, and much more.
