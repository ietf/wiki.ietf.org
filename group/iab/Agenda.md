### 1. Review of the ICANN Public Comment on Functional Model for Root Server System Governance

- A reminder to review the [IAB Response to the ICANN Public Comment on Functional Model for Root Server System Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsU_mQGCmcvci_CV9SIfvRzc1CCKTn_ZqJQekvGGNmY/edit?usp=sharing) 


### 2. WSIS+20 Zero Draft 

- The [zero draft](https://publicadministration.desa.un.org/sites/default/files/2021-04/2025/WSIS%2B20_ZERO_DRAFT.pdf) is published. The IAB might want to respond 
- [Initial Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Qq7-4gYv6ISPTIzBBpMNkmkpnKtSVI5DucOo3Mp5ww/edit?usp=sharing), pen holder - Dhruv 
- Deadline for written submission is 26th Sept.  


### 3. ISOC Coordination (Mirja)

- At every IETF meeting can we reserve one slot (Sunday or breakfast meeting) for ISOC? Reasoning: Of course we can always explicitly ask ISOC to report on a specific topic but if we have a fixed slot reserved and ask them to propose a topic, I think that would give us some additional interesting insight and could also help to have some continuity in information exchange and build relations with different people from ISOC. (Mirja)


### 4. Supporting Information to be provided to the IAB by the NomCom (Alvaro)

Please review the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4lPp5w722iC-Jo5hmjBhYlaj0IjjxuL2sJaauH1iPs/edit?usp=sharing) and share your comments. I would like us to finalize the text by our formal meeting on the 24th.
