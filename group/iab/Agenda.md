## Topics for Future Informal Meetings

ISOC Coordination (Mirja)

- At every IETF meeting can we reserve one slot (Sunday or breakfast meeting) for ISOC? Reasoning: Of course we can always explicitly ask ISOC to report on a specific topic but if we have a fixed slot reserved and ask them to propose a topic, I think that would give us some additional interesting insight and could also help to have some continuity in information exchange and build relations with different people from ISOC. (Mirja)
