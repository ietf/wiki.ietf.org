### 1. IAB Member Onboarding and Review

Slides: [IAB Member Onboarding and Review](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CpjUKvENgo37gjDHAO4VlPCLzKgSC5yChKJYdc8LGp4/edit?usp=sharing)

### 2. Discuss Draft ISE Consulation Survey
Document: [Draft IAB ISE Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsFvatT16cyh05DTN0NlQ0n9wZyDJlbDbaPZJ-peKm0/edit?tab=t.0) The sub-group working on this is Roman, Fluffy, Dhruv, and Jason. This is a draft and we'd like to explore Dhruv's feedback that perhaps some of the questions should be more open-ended. The sub-group has struggled to act on this via async collaboration and felt it easier to have a live discussion.

### 3. Executive Session: IAB Chair Discussion (includes incoming members)


## Regrets





## Topics for Future Informal Meetings

### ETSI liaison discussion
