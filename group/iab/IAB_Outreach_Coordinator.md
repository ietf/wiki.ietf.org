# IAB Outreach Coordinator
## Roles and Responsibilities
The IAB Outreach coordinator is responsible for planning, coordinating, and keeping track of the Outreach activities undertaken by the IETF Leadership.

The IAB Outreach Coordinator role is usually executed by one IAB member. The IAB assigns the Outreach Coordinator role during the process of selecting all of the annual IAB roles during its March pre-IETF meeting.

Outreach Coordinator Tasks

- Planning for the Outreach calendar for the IAB
  - Maintaining a list of potential external communities and events for outreach
  - Maintaining the list of organizations and events that the IAB members are already active in and regularly attending
  - Help the IAB shortlist outreach activities based on the outreach goals and interests of the IAB members
  - Identify who will take part in the outreach activity
  - Identify Outreach activity that requires the use of the IAB Budget (if needed).
- Help to organize outreach activities (target: 1-2 per year)
  - Work with the IAB and IESG members who would participate in an outreach activity in preparing proposals, making submissions, and overall tracking of the outreach activity till completion. This also includes the outreach material presented.
- Maintain a list of outreach activities undertaken and any useful follow up
- Coordinate with IESG (via the liaisons) to keep them informed about the IAB Outreach activities, take inputs and work closely with them.
- Coordinate with EODIR and keep them in the loop with any outreach activity
- Work closely with the IETF LLC staff responsible for communications and fundraising
- Potential contact point for the community for questions about IAB outreach

## Relationship with EODIR
EODIR seeks to coordinate outreach activities for the IETF undertaken by individuals and organizations. EODIR outreach is directed towards potential new IETF participants (network operators, enterprises, educational institutes, regions with less participation, etc.) but may also track outreach activities undertaken by others targeted to non-participants. The outreach for the IAB is mainly targeted toward reaching out to technical communities.

## Relationship with ISOC
The Internet Society performs extensive policy and technical outreach activities in the execution of its own mission and planned activities. Where the interests and objectives of these activities overlap with the IAB, the Internet Society and the IAB will work to ensure the two organizations are well informed and coordinated. This coordination will include the IAB Outreach Coordinator and the ISOC Liaison to the IAB. The IAB-ISOC Policy Coordination Administrative Support group may also be engaged in the discussion and coordination as appropriate.

## Outreach Coverage
We need to make sure we have good diversity and coverage in the outreach activities selected such that we realize some outreach opportunities every year (i.e., ideally based on the interest or plans of members who already participate in certain events) and also that we don't end up with the same community and events every year. 

**IAB Outreach Coordinator Email**: You can send email to the IAB outreach coordinators at outreach@iab.org. The current IAB outreach coordinator is [Dhruv Dhody](https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/dhruv.ietf@gmail.com).
