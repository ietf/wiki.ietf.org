# Guidance for External (Non-IETF) Events

This page provides guidance for IAB members when participating in external events that are not sponsored or organized by the IETF/ISOC. 

The intent is to support  community outreach while avoiding confusion about official IETF endorsement.

## Relationship to Existing Guidance

General guidance for speaking about the IETF at external events applies broadly to IETF leadership:

- https://chairs.ietf.org/en/speaking

Participants in external events are expected to be familiar with and follow the principles outlined in that guidance.

## Principles

### Outreach and Community Benefit

Participation in external events can benefit the broader IETF community by:

- Increasing awareness of IETF work
- Encouraging participation from new or under-represented communities
- Supporting education about IETF processes and technologies

Such engagement should be understood as sharing information *about* the IETF and its work, and not as implying official endorsement of the event, its organizers, or its positions.

### Perception of Endorsement

Participation by IETF leadership in an external event may be perceived as an endorsement by the IETF. To reduce this risk:

- Consider whether the event presents itself as affiliated with or endorsed by the IETF
- Use appropriate disclaimers to clarify the independent nature of the event and the individual nature of participation
- Avoid framing participation as representing an official IETF position unless explicitly authorized

## Practical Guidelines

The following considerations may help inform decisions about participating in external events. These are guiding principles rather than strict requirements:

- The event aligns with the mission and values of the IETF
- The event provides clear outreach, educational, or community benefit to the IETF
- The event is community-led rather than primarily commercial
- The nature of participation does not create confusion about IETF sponsorship or endorsement
- The purpose of the invitation and expected contribution are clear

Judgment and context are expected to play a central role; rigid checklists are not intended. Reaching out to full IAB for transparency and advice when in doubt. 

### Individual Judgment and Case-by-Case Decisions

Decisions about participation in external events are expected to be made on a case-by-case basis. When uncertain, seeking input from peers, chairs, or outreach coordinators is encouraged.

## Suggested Disclaimer

When appropriate, the following disclaimer (or similar language) may be used:

> Participation in this event by IETF leadership does not imply endorsement by the IETF, the IAB, the IESG, or the IETF-LLC. The views expressed are those of the individual and may not represent official IETF positions. This event is not affiliated with or sponsored by the IETF.

## Transparency and Tracking

To support consistency and visibility:

- Leadership participation in external events should be recorded in the IETF outreach tracker
- Sharing outcomes, slides, or brief summaries is encouraged where appropriate
- Outreach coordinators may help maintain visibility across activities

## High Visibility Engagements

Certain engagements—such as keynote speeches, openings, or events involving policymakers or industry consortia—may require additional consideration. These should be evaluated carefully, taking into account context, perception, and expected impact.
