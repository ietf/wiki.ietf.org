**Job:**

Chair of the ITU-T-Liaison group

> - Support IAB, IESG and other I* people with "political" tactics in the relationship with ITU-T
> - Keep track of the developments in ITU that may be relevant to the IETF. Filter information/rumours from ITU-T so that the "correct" level in I* (ISOC, IAB, IESG, Area Director, wg chair, liaison etc) get the information
> - Maintain continuity of the relationship with ITU. Be the individual that stay in touch with equivalent in ITU-T (TSB)
> - Facilitate coordination of communication and positions of the IAB/IETF with ISOC and other SDOs when needed. Work when needed also with non-SDOs regarding tactics.

Together with the liaison coordinators in the IAB maintain continuity and context of the liaison exchanges and ensure the ITU-T liaisons are allocated properly

> - Keep track of (with the help of the liaison tool) incoming and outgoing liaisons
> - Assign actions on incoming liaisons that do not have a clear destination
> - Approximately quarterly plus at IETF meeting (as result of the filtering) -- summarise status on issues to IESG and IAB (on request and when needed)
> - Work closely with IAB and IESG chairs on tactics, often on very short notice
> - Manage the mailing list for ITU-T liaisons
> - Be the main token holder of features/bugs in the IETF liaison tool (as ITU-T liaison is the "heaviest")

Independence

> - Being able to convey and defend IAB/IETF positions, even if they conflict with conflict with employer positions or national positions

 Have time allocated

> - Estimate is one full day a week, but very unevenly distributed. In critical situations can go up to 2 days/week
> - Attend the IETF meetings
> - Be prepared to go to the GSC meetings once a year
> - Be prepared to go to IAB meetings outside of IETF
> - Be prepared to go to Geneva (other ITU-T liaisons take care of specific SG meetings)


## IETF Liaison Templates and Coordination 

All incoming liaisons are replied to by the liaison manager using email (in a timely fashion).  Liaison responses are either boilerplate or crafted using with the following guidelines:
1. Informational
  * The liaison manager sends an __email__ acknowledging receipt
     * For IETF: [Template-Email-IETF-Info](https://github.com/intarchboard/liaison-templates/blob/main/Template-Email-IETF-Info.md)
     * For IRTF: [Template-Email-IRTF](https://github.com/intarchboard/liaison-templates/blob/main/Template-Email-IRTF.md)
  * An __outgoing liaison__ can be sent, but the default case is that no official liaison reply is sent.
2. Action
  * The liaison manager sends an __email__ acknowledging receipt
     * For IETF: [Template-Email-IETF-Action](https://github.com/intarchboard/liaison-templates/blob/main/Template-Email-IETF-Action.md)
     * For IRTF: [Template-Email-IRTF](https://github.com/intarchboard/liaison-templates/blob/main/Template-Email-IRTF.md)
       * Note:  IRTF uses same template for Incoming Liaisons regardless of status.
  * Before the __deadline__ one of two things happens
     * The liaison manager sends a boilerplate liaison response
       * For IETF: [Template-Liaison-IETF-Action-Response](https://github.com/intarchboard/liaison-templates/blob/main/Template-Liaison-IETF-Action-Response.md)
       * For IRTF: [Template-Liaison-IRTF-Action-Response](https://github.com/intarchboard/liaison-templates/blob/main/Template-Liaison-IRTF-Action-Response.md)

     --or--

     * The liaison manager coordinates a crafted liaison response with the interested parties from the IETF/IAB/IRTF etc.  There is no template for this type of response.
