## ISOC Board of Trustees
ISOC BoT appointment procedures are based on RFC 3677 and the [ISOC Board of Trustees Bylaws](http://www.internetsociety.org/who-we-are/governance-and-policies/amended-and-restated-laws-internet-society). Note, that there was a change to the bylaws in 2013 such that the IETF appoints two members every 3 years. That change starts in 2015. Thus, the number of appointments for upcoming years is as follows:

> 2024: name two board members
> 2025: name one board members
> 2026: name one board members
> 2027: name two board members

TODO: Add to the call that candidates for the ISOC BOT for the IAB should not also be active candidates in either the ISOC chapters election or the ISOC organization election for the BOT.

## ISOC BOT Description
Source: [ISOC 2015 Call for Nominations](http://www.internetsociety.org/2015-call-nominations-internet-society-board-trustees)

The Internet Society (ISOC) is a global not-for-profit organization founded in 1992 to provide leadership in Internet related standards, education and policy. With offices in Washington, DC, and Geneva, Switzerland, as well as regional bureaus located throughout the world, it is dedicated to ensuring the open development, evolution, and use of the Internet for the benefit of people globally. ISOC is also the organizational home of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other Internet-related bodies who together play a critical role in ensuring that the Internet develops in a stable and open manner. ISOC has more than 150 organizational members, over 100 chapters and more than 65,000 individual members that play a role in driving the mission and work of the organization. ISOC currently has an operational budget of USD 38 million.

The ISOC Board of Trustees is responsible for the governance of the organization, and its authority is derived from the organization’s by-laws and policies. The composition of the Board includes 12 Trustees, 4 of whom are elected by ISOC Organizational Members, 4 of whom are elected by Chapters, and 4 selected by the IETF following the process documented in RFC 3677.* Procedures for the selection of Trustees are available here. The ISOC CEO and President serves ex-officio as a non-voting member of the Board.

### Time Commitment
Trustees are expected to commit the time necessary to perform regular Board and committee business. Trustees are also expected to allocate time to attend and prepare for meetings.

Board Meetings: three physical meetings per year that are 2 days in length plus travel time. These meetings are typically co-located with one IETF meeting, one ICANN meeting, and one ISOC event each year.

Strategic Planning Retreat: generally one per year over 2 days plus travel time.

Conference calls: generally three to four 2-hour teleconferences per year.

Committees: participation in at least one committee.

Email correspondence: while most Trustee work is conducted during board and committee meetings and calls, there will be occasions when emerging strategic and governance issues require participation of board members via email discussions, polls and surveys.

### Eligibility Statement
Candidates for ISOC Trustee will have demonstrable involvement in the Internet with deep understanding in at least two of the following areas:

- Internet standards
- Internet operation
- Public policy for Internet and telecommunications
- Internet development

As noted in Section 2 of RFC 3677, the IAB expects candidates to have IETF experience:

*  Candidates for an ISOC Trustee should have a demonstrable involvement in the IETF with a particular focus on active participation in IETF Working Groups.*

Ideal candidates will also have a good understanding of broader technology, policy, business and/or economic issues relevant to the Society.

The following qualifications are also highly desirable:

- Previous board or leadership experience, especially for not-for-profit entities
- Skills in organizational management and leadership
- Financial oversight and fund raising
- The ability to identify relevant ISOC projects and attendant community engagement models
- Vision for the role of the Internet Society

The ISOC Board of Trustees aims to be as broadly representative of the many cultures and communities around the world that it can. While all qualified candidates are welcome, we strongly encourage members from currently under-represented areas to nominate candidates. In this light, nominations of candidates from Africa, the Middle East and Central and South America; younger candidates, women and those with the lived experience of disability are encouraged.

## IETF member to the ICANN Nomcom
This is a yearly appointment, usually driven by the ICANN Nomcom cycle: An appointment needs to be made by the IAB shortly after a previous ICANN Nomcom finished its work.

ICANN Nomcom members are appointed by the IAB for the IETF on a yearly bases and may serve 2 consecutive terms (per ICANN bylaws). The IAB has not committed itself to a particular process for selection. However, a general call for volunteers followed by selection (executive session) without any further community consultation has been the mode of operation. In general a reappointment for a second term is done after (executive session) review.

## IETF members to the ICANN TLG
Article XI-A, Section 2, Paragraph 6 of the ICANN Bylaws asks each of the four TLG members (IETF, ITU-T, ETSI, and W3C) to “designate two individual technical experts who are familiar with the technical standards issues that are relevant to ICANN's activities. These 8 experts shall be available as necessary to determine, through an exchange of e-mail messages, where to direct a technical question from ICANN when ICANN does not ask a specific TLG organization directly.”

The IAB appoints these technical experts on behalf of the IETF. The IAB has not committed itself to a particular process for selection, and ICANN Bylaws do not impose any constraints on this process. The IAB has chosen to use a three step process: (1) a general call for volunteers; (2) a call for comments on the list of volunteers; and (3) selection by the IAB in executive session without any further community consultation.

To provide for continuity, each year, the IAB has chosen to select a technical expert for a two-year term. If needed, the IAB will select a replacement for a technical expert that cannot continue to serve for any reason.
