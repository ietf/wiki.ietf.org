# IAB Decision taking

IAB decision taking is documented in RFC 2850:

> 3.5 Decision taking
> 
>   The IAB attempts to reach all decisions unanimously.  If unanimity
>   cannot be achieved, the chair may conduct informal polls to determine
>   consensus.  The IAB may make decisions and take action if at least
>   seven full members concur and there are no more than two dissents.
> 
>   The IAB may reach decisions by face to face meeting, teleconference,
>   Internet communication, or any combination of the above.

Practically, in most day-to-day business, the chair will determine consensus
based on the absence of dissenting positions being put forward in a reasonable
time. However, some decisions are deemed important enough or controversial
enough to require a formal vote. This document outlines the process used by the
IAB to make such decisions.

# Decision Process

## Open vs Secret Ballots

Votes can either use open or secret ballots. The first step in the process is
for the IAB chair to determine whether it will be held open or secret.

- By default, votes should be open.

- Open ballots are only shared with voting members (IAB members minus
  disqualified and recused members).

- Open ballots can be submitted either by email to the list of voting members
  or as verbal votes during an IAB teleconference.

- Secret ballots are only shared with the Executive Director and Chair.

- If there is no consensus among voting members on whether a vote should be
  open or secret, the vote will be by secret ballot.

- If a vote starts off open but two voting members then request that it be
  secret, then the voting restarts with secret ballots.

## Normal Process

The IAB chair (or executive director on the instructions of the chair) will 
typically follow this process to initiate a vote:

- The chair emails the list of voting members to start an email discussion on
  the topic, optionally indicating that the ballots will be secret.

- Discussion and votes will continue on the voting members list, and during any
  teleconference(s) that occur.

- The vote will typically stay open until a position has been recorded for every
  single voting member, even after a majority has been reached. This ensures
  every voice can be heard. Note that it is reasonable for any voting member to
  request a few days to review available information before voting.

- At the chair's option, a vote can be held open until there is an opportunity
  to discuss it in the next meeting. Likewise, if more than two voting members
  request discussion in the next meeting, the vote will remain open until that
  discussion takes place. Here, 'next meeting' is the next regularly scheduled
  meeting more than 48 hours after the first request is received, or in the
  case of an irregularly scheduled meeting, 7 days after that time.

- Absent that, if the vote has enough affirmative votes that it would pass if all
  remaining votes were dissents, and at least 7 days have elapsed since the
  vote was announced, then the chair can decide to declare the vote closed and
  successful. This avoids deadlock if a voting member is unable or unwilling to vote.

## Alternative Process

The IAB can use alternative voting processes. In order to do that, the IAB
chair must announce the alternative voting rules to the IAB at least one week
before the voting takes place. If any voting member of the IAB objects to the
alternative voting rules, the resolution of the conflict will be addressed
following usual RFC 2850 guidelines; i.e., if more than two voting members
object to the alternative voting process, the vote reverts to the Normal
Process.

Note that any alternative process still needs to follow the rules in Section
3.5 of RFC 2850.
