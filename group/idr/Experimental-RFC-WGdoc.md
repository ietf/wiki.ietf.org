# Status of IDR Experiments 

Experimental RFCs are used to try out new paradigms.  This page provides the status of IDR Experimental RFC and WG documents.

# Intent Based (Color) Routing Experiment 

The intent-based/Color paradigm is a new paradigm for IDR. 
The experiment will continue for 1-3 years to allow deployments to inform the final specification. 

For this instance, IDR has let two functionally equivalent, but operationally different standards go forward.  The operator community is needed to determine if the operational differences between the two specifications make a different. 

In contrast, CPR does not specify new protocols but uses configuration to support Intent based routing with IPv6.

# New SR Segment types 

The experiment with the SR segment types is whether the Spring defined SR types beyond the first two (a + b) will actually be used in implementations.  In order to encourage these SR segement types to be used, the document defines the segement types. 

We'll review the progress on these segement types for 1-3 years (2025-2027).
