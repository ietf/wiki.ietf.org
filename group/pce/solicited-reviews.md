# Solicited Review from PCE WG chairs

In an effort to expedite the processing of items in the WG queues [1][2] and to encourage more active participation and feedback, we have decided to request some of the authors whose documents are also in the queue. We kindly request  assistance in reviewing drafts that are currently in the adoption/WGLC. This is essential for ensuring that the working group's outputs are thoroughly examined and that any consensus (or lack thereof) is appropriately reflected in our mailing list discussions.
