# OS current practices
   
   Most modern OSes (especially mobile ones) do implement by default some MAC address randomization policy. Table 1 summarizes current practices for Androiod and iOS, as the time of writing this document
   (original source posted at: [Private MAC address on iOS 14](https://www.fing.com/news/private-mac-address-on-ios-14), latest wayback machine's snapshot available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230905111429/https://www.fing.com/news/private-mac-address-on-ios-14), updated based on findings from the authors of [draft-ietf-madinas-mac-address-randomization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-madinas-mac-address-randomization/).

        Table 1: Android and iOS MAC address randomization practices

   In September 2021, we have performed some additional tests to
   evaluate how most widely used OSes behave regarding MAC address
   randomization.  Table 2 summarizes our findings, where show on
   different rows whether the OS performs address randomization per
   network (PNGM according to the taxonomy introduced in Section 7 of
   [RFC9274](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9724).), per
   new connection (PSGM), daily (PPGM with a period of 24h), supports
   configuration per SSID, supports address randomization for scanning,
   and whether it does that by default.

      Table 2: Observed behavior from different OS (as of September
                                  2021)

   According to ["MAC Randomization Behavior"](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/wifi-mac-randomization-behavior), starting in Android 12, Android uses non-persistent randomization in the following situations: (i) a
   network suggestion app specifies that non-persistant randomization be used for the network (through an API); or (ii) the network is an open network that hasn't encountered a captive portal and an internal
   config option is set to do so (by default it is not).
