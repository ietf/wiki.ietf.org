# VWRAP Glossary
*Under construction. Editing this page is encouraged, however, for significant changes discuss your edits on the VWRAP Mailing list - vwrap@ietf.org.*

A glossary of terms with specific meanings within the project, defined so that discussions can be concise and misunderstandings fewer. This glossary currently is a compilation of terms from different sources (as referenced) to act as a basis for the final VWRAP glossary. Please make sure that everything you add has a source (or signature). It should be noted that some of the definitions are only intended to be used in a particular context. The [AWG wiki glossary](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Second_Life_Grid_Glossary) for instance explicitly states:

> "Please note that this glossary is specific to the SL Architecture Working Group and is intended for use only within the context of Second Life. The definitions are not expressed in a generic manner, and should not be interpreted that way".

Nevertheless, some of the SL specific AWG terms are copied here for easy reference.

### Agent
- An "agent" is the abstract information-oriented representation of a user in the system. An agent differs from an "avatar" in that it is not a visual representation and intended to be manipulated and observed by computing systems (not people.) ​vwrap-intro-00
- An Agent is a software resource which represents some portion of a user in the virtual world. Agents are hosted in agent servers. An agent may cause an avatar to be instantiated on behalf of a user. An Agent mediates, for the user, by acting as the software endpoint in the system which invokes various services within the web at the user's direction, generally via the user's client. [AWG wiki glossary](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Second_Life_Grid_Glossary)
### Agent domain
### Authentication ("Auth") Service
A service responsible for accepting user credentials and providing service endpoints for other services.​vwrap-intro-00
### Avatar
The "avatar" is the user's (mostly) visual representation in the virtual world. It is the entity that end users (humans) are likely interested in interacting with. vwrap-intro-00
### Client Application
- A "client application" is any application that mostly consumes virtual world services. Client applications may or may not be "user agents." Source: vwrap-intro-00
- Any program or device which enables the perception of "virtual place" to occur in the minds of users, through display of graphics, audio, text, Braille, or other types of media. [Morgaine Dinova](http://vwrap-playpen.wikispaces.com/New+VWRAP+intro+draft)
### Grid
### Interoperability
- (between worlds) Interoperation of Virtual Worlds occurs when media elements from more than one Virtual World are present in a given perceptual mashup.
- (between worlds) Interoperability between (instances of) any two virtual world systems conforming to the (to be defined) VWRAP standard. [Boroondas Gupte]
- (service level)
### Region
A "region" is the set of data maintained by a "simulator." vwrap-intro-00
### Region domain
### Simulator
A service whose primary responsibility is to simulate 3d spaces (including physics simulation and object presence maintenance) is termed a "Simulator." vwrap-intro-00
### Trust domain
???
### User
The entity controlling an avatar in world is the "user". vwrap-intro-00
### User Agent
A "user agent" is a client application operated predominantly by an end user.  vwrap-intro-00
### Viewer
### Virtual World
- A perceptual mashup depicting media elements located within a single virtual place based on data received by a client application. [Morgaine Dinova](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/vwrap/current/msg00319.html)
### VWRAP
Virtual Worlds Region Agent Protocol. [VWRAP Draft Charter: 2009 08 28 revision](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ogpx/current/thrd2.html#00249)
