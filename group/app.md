# IETF Applications Area 
The IETF Applications Area has merged with the RAI Area. The combined Area is Applications and Real Time (ART). These pages provide information about application protocols such as email and the web. For general discussion of ART related topics, join the [art](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/art) mailing list.

Specification authors will want to be familiar with [TypicalAppsAreaIssues](/group/app/TypicalAppsAreaIssues) that often need to be addressed in Internet-Drafts. Authors might also find the following tools to be helpful:

- [ABNF Checker](/group/art)http://tools.ietf.org/tools/bap/abnf.cgi)
- [Email Header Checker](http://tools.ietf.org/tools/msglint/)
- [IDnits](http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/)
- [Tools Team Tools](http://tools.ietf.org/inventory/verif-tools)
- [xml2rfc](http://xml.resource.org/)
- [xml2rfc Validator](http://fenron.net/~fenner/ietf/xml2rfc-valid/)
- [XML Schema Validator](http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv)
- [XML Schema Validator (alternate)](http://validate.openlaboratory.net/)
