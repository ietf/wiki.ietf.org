# End Middle End Research Group (EME) (Concluded)

*NOTE: This research group is **concluded.** This wiki is for historic purposes and the links were accurate at the conclusion of the research group. *

Welcome to the EME Wiki Page.  On this page you will find the Charter of the group, along with any useful information pertaining to research being done by the group.

## About End-to-Middle 

The de facto Internet architecture is very different from what was envisioned when it's core 
semantics were designed. While still end-to-end in many ways, connection establishment in the 
Internet today involves state and functionality in the middle in the form of NATs, firewalls, 
proxies and so on. The accepted Internet architecture does not reflect this resulting in a 
mismatch between design and practice. This IRTF group aims to explore the problem-space 
presented by today's Internet and come up with a new Internet architecture that incorporates 
both the end and the middle. 

In an attempt to map out the problem space, some point-solutions are presented that demonstrate 
how one might establish connections in a future Internet. 

Signaling based solutions to connection establishment 

* NUTSS primarily relies on off-path signaling 

* CSP primarily relies on on-path signaling 

## Draft EME Signaling Protocol Design

**Abstract**

>    This document presents a high-level design for an End-Middle-End
>    (EME) signaling protocol called NUTSS (which stands for NAT, URI,
>    Tunnel, Signaling, STUN).  While high-level, this document tries to
>    be detailed enough that the EME RG can have a meaningful debate about
>    its pros and cons and possible alternatives.  The main attribute of
>    NUTSS is that it couples together both path-coupled and path-
>    decoupled signaling.
