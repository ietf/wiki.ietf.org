# Internet-of-Things Directorate

## Charter
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to devices, that are often constrained in communication and computation capabilities, now becoming more commonly connected to the Internet, and various services that are built on top of the capabilities these devices jointly provide. It is expected that this development will usher in more machine-to-machine communication using the Internet with no human user actively involved.


Several working groups, spanning multiple areas within the IETF are developing protocols that are directly relevant to the IoT. In many cases, there is little or no organized coordination between these working groups.


In addition to internal IETF coordination, there is increasing need for communicating with other [IotSdos IoT standard organizations and alliances] that are developing solutions. IoT is a very rapidly growing area of technology and connects with number of other emerging technologies. Many organizations outside IETF are not well aware of IoT work at IETF.

The IoT Directorate is an advisory group of experts selected by the Internet Area directors and the Directorate Chairs. The main purpose of the Directorate is coordination within IETF IoT groups and increasing IETF IoT standards visibility to external SDOs, alliances, and other organizations.

The primary tasks performed by the IoT Directorates are:
* Reviewing IoT-relevant documents and other issues when requested by the Internet Area Directors, IETF WG chairs or other area directors for opinions/input on document relevance, or conflicts with other WG work. The Directorate may also point to a subject matter expert or a relevant working group as the home of new work items. For example:
  * Does the issue follow and conform to (or is in the spirit of) existing conventions, whether documented or not?
  * Does the issue warrant "going through" a particular non-IoT Working Group process or is the issue significant enough to justify joint review with a relevant IoT WG?

* Acting as a resource for answering IoT-related questions that working groups encounter in their work on non-IoT protocols. For example:
  * If 6man WG is making changes to Neighbor Discovery, questions may arise as to whether these changes have special impact on 6tisch or 6lowpan networks. The IoT Directorate would, if asked, act as a resource for getting answers to those questions.

* Cross-working group coordination efforts, such as
  * Should a document be reviewed jointly by multiple IoT groups where the work overlaps multiple groups' charters?
  * When a new idea is proposed for work at the IETF, helping to decide whether a research group or a working group should work on the idea, or whether it should not be worked on in the IETF.
  * When an idea being worked on in a research group matures, helping to determine whether it should now be worked on in an IETF working group.
  * Discuss upcoming plug-test events, workshops etc. activities ahead of time in IoT Directorate for conflict avoidance and scheduling

* Being a focal point for external organizations
  * The IAB Liaison Manager and Internet Area ADs should be the first point of contact for external parties to about IETF work. The responsible AD may delegate the responsibilities to IoT Directorate Chairs for further communications
  * The Directorate shall produce basic information about IoT at IETF for external communication
  * The Directorate members are encouraged to speak at relevant IoT external events about IETF work
  * The Directorate communicates with other SDO members to bring them into IETF for presentations and informal communications
  * The IoT Directorate facilitates maintaining an IoT@IETF informational webpage for external communication

When to contact IoT Directorate chairs:
* When unsure whether or not some proposed work belongs in an existing IoT working group, research group, or might motivate the creation of a new IoT group
* When multi-IoT group review is needed
* When non-IETF community requires information about IoT at IETF
* When someone is working on a presentation about IoT work within the IETF and wants some cross-area review of the presentation

Chairs' Role in Cross-area coordination and outreach:
* IoT Directorate chairs may contact relevant Area Directors or WG chairs when a new work or a document needs their attention
* The chairs may be contacted by IoT Directorate members, Internet Area Directors, or other IETF members to arrange informational meetings with other IoT related SDOs. The chairs will facilitate such meetings by coordinating through IoT Directorate members and relevant WGs at the IETF.
* The chairs may also involve the IETF IAB Liaison Manager for outreach of an external SDO.

IoT Directorate will do two different types of reviews:
* Look at a document and see if it appears to have any special considerations relating to IoT technology and operations
* Do a thorough review of a document and provide feedback on the document to whoever requested the review, and to the Area Directors

How the IoT Directorate document review is organized:
* Working group chairs, directorate chairs, and ADs can request a document review at any time using the IETF Datatracker page of a draft. Alternatively review can be requested by contacting [mailto:int-ads@ietf.org Internet ADs] or [mailto:iot-dir-owner@ietf.org IoT directorate chairs] via e-mail.
* To the extent possible, document reviews will be spread across the entire membership of the IoT Directorate
* Exceptions to this policy will be made when a particular IoT Directorate member has special knowledge of the particular topic of the requested review, but the chairs will ensure that the workload on any individual participant is similar to that of other participants

* Whenever a document comes in for review, the chairs will attempt to identify a reviewer using two parallel methods:
  * A request for a volunteer to review the document will go out, with a time limit of three business days
  * A member will be chosen on a round-robin basis, and will be sent a notification that they have been assigned; they should not begin reviewing the document immediately, but should simply indicate whether or not they are able to review this particular document


 Reasons to decline review include:
    * Not this reviewer's particular IoT area of expertise
    * Reviewer is not available

* After three business days, if a volunteer has been identified that volunteer is directed to begin the review
* The IoT Directorate chairs may re-assign the document to another volunteer member if the reviews are not performed by the committed date without any valid reason

* In many cases it may be necessary to ask for help from non-IoT experts; in this case the Directorate chairs will liaise with chairs of other Directorates and Working Groups whose charter covers that area of knowledge.


IoT Directorate membership and participation criteria:

* The pool of potential volunteers includes anyone who is recognized as having significant expertise in IoT work within the IETF and who is willing to do document reviews
* Members may be appointed by IoT Directorate chairs or by INT Area Directors, and may be suggested by chairs of any working group
* Membership is renewable for a two-year term
* Active members are expected to review documents when requested, within reason
* In some cases members may be included who do not have time to fulfil the role of active members in the sense of reviewing documents, but who are still considered valuable resources for the Directorate. Ordinarily, however, members are expected to participate in the document review process, and a failure to do so will result in the membership being revoked.
* Membership in the IoT Directorate is provisional for new members. Prospective members are asked to write a letter explaining why it makes sense for them to be on the Directorate. Inclusion in the directorate will be subject to AD and/or chair approval.
