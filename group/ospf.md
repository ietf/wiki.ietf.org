# Welcome to the OSPF Working Group Web page
OSPF working group (WG) advances the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol.

## Implementation Requirement
While OSPF doesn't require implementations for all WG drafts, substantive revisions to the protocol will require implementations. The decision as to whether or not a protocol change requires implementations is to be decided by the chairs in consultation with the working group.

## Draft Implementation status
- [Protocol implementations Reports](/group/ospf/ProtocolImplementationReports)
## OSPF Interims
None currently scheduled.
