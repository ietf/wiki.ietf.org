**The Trac Configuration File**
Trac is configured through the `trac.ini` file, located in the `< projectenv >/conf `directory. The `trac.ini` configuration file and its parent directory should be writable by the web server.

Trac monitors the timestamp of the file to trigger a complete environment reload and flush its caches when the timestamp changes. Most changes to the configuration will be reflected immediately, though changes to the [components] or [logging] sections will require restarting the web server. You may also need to restart the web server after creating a global configuration file when none was previously present.

## Global Configuration
Configuration can be shared among environments using one or more global configuration files. Options in the global configuration will be merged with the environment-specific options, with local options overriding global options. The global configuration file is specified as follows:
```
[inherit]
 file = /path/to/global/trac.ini
```

Multiple files can be specified using a comma-separated list.

Note that you can also specify a global option file when creating a new project, by adding the option `--inherit=/path/to/global/trac.ini` to trac-admin's `initenv` command. If you do not do this but nevertheless intend to use a global option file with your new environment, you will have to go through the newly generated `conf/trac.ini` file and delete the entries that will otherwise override those set in the global file.

There are two more entries in the [inherit] section, `templates_dir` for sharing global templates and `plugins_dir`, for sharing plugins. Those entries can themselves be specified in the shared configuration file, and in fact, configuration files can even be chained if you specify another `[inherit] file` there.

Note that the templates found in the `templates/` directory of the [TracEnvironment](/group/rtgwg/TracEnvironment) have precedence over those found in `[inherit] templates_dir`. In turn, the latter have precedence over the installed templates, so be careful about what you put there. Notably, if you override a default template, refresh your modifications when you upgrade to a new version of Trac. The preferred way to perform [TracInterfaceCustomization](/group/rtgwg/TracInterfaceCustomization) is still to write a custom plugin doing an appropriate `ITemplateStreamFilter` transformation.

## Reference for settings
This is a brief reference of available configuration options, and their default settings.

Documentation improvements should be discussed on the [trac-dev mailing list](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MailingList#Trac-dev) or described in a [ticket](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/NewTicket). Even better, [submit a patch](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev/SubmittingPatches) against the docstrings in the code.

### [attachment]
| `max_size`              | Maximum allowed file size (in bytes) for attachments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 262144  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `max_zip_size`          | Maximum allowed total size (in bytes) for an attachment list to be downloadable as a `.zip`. Set this to -1 to disable download as `.zip`. (since 1.0)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2097152 |
| `render_unsafe_content` | Whether attachments should be rendered in the browser, or only made downloadable. Pretty much any file may be interpreted as HTML by the browser, which allows a malicious user to attach a file containing cross-site scripting attacks. For public sites where anonymous users can create attachments it is recommended to leave this option disabled (which is the default). | false   |
### [browser]
| `color_scale`           | Enable colorization of the age column. This uses the same color scale as the source code annotation: blue is older, red is newer. (since 0.11)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | enabled                      |

| `downloadable_paths`    | List of repository paths that can be downloaded. Leave this option empty if you want to disable all downloads, otherwise set it to a comma-separated list of authorized paths (those paths are glob patterns, i.e. "*" can be used as a wild card). In a multi-repository environment, the path must be qualified with the repository name if the path does not point to the default repository (e.g. /reponame/trunk). Note that a simple prefix matching is performed on the paths, so aliases won't get automatically resolved. (since 0.10) | /trunk, /branches/*, /tags/* |
|` hide_properties`       | Comma-separated list of version control properties to hide from the repository browser. (since 0.9)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | svk:merge                    |
| `intermediate_color`    | (r,g,b) color triple to use for the color corresponding to the intermediate color, if two linear interpolations are used for the color scale (see intermediate_point). If not set, the intermediate color between `oldest_color` and `newest_color` will be used.

| intermediate_point    | If set to a value between 0 and 1 (exclusive), this will be the point chosen to set the intermediate_color for interpolating the color value.

### [changeset]
| `max_diff_bytes`       | Maximum total size in bytes of the modified files (their old size plus their new size) for which the changeset view will attempt to show the diffs inlined (since 0.10). | 10000000 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `max_diff_files`       | Maximum number of modified files for which the changeset view will attempt to show the diffs inlined (since 0.10).                                                       | 0        |
| `wiki_format_messages` | Whether wiki formatting should be applied to changeset messages. If this option is disabled, changeset messages will be rendered as pre-formatted text.                  | true     |
### [components]
This section is used to enable or disable components provided by plugins, as well as by Trac itself. The component to enable/disable is specified via the name of the option. Whether its enabled is determined by the option value; setting the value to `enabled` or `on` will enable the component, any other value (typically `disabled` or `off`) will disable the component.

The option name is either the fully qualified name of the components or the module/package prefix of the component. The former enables/disables a specific component, while the latter enables/disables any component in the specified package/module.

Consider the following configuration snippet:
```
[components]
trac.ticket.report.ReportModule = disabled
webadmin.* = enabled
```
The first option tells Trac to disable the [report module](/groups/rtgwg/TracPermissions). The second option instructs Trac to enable all components in the `webadmin` package. Note that the trailing wildcard is required for module/package matching.

To view the list of active components, go to the Plugins page on About Trac (requires `CONFIG_VIEW` [permissions](/group/rtgwg/TracPermissions).

### [header_logo]
| `alt`    | Alternative text for the header logo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) |

| `src`    | URL of the image to use as header logo. It can be absolute, server relative or relative. If relative, it is relative to one of the `/chrome` locations: `site/your-logo.png` if `your-logo.png` is located in the htdocs folder within your [TracEnvironment](/group/rtgwg/TracEnvironment); `common/your-logo.png` if `your-logo.png` is located in the folder mapped to the htdocs_location URL. Only specifying `your-logo.png` is equivalent to the latter. | site/your_project_logo.png                               |

### [inherit]
|` htdocs_dir`    | Path to the shared htdocs directory. Static resources in that directory are mapped to /chrome/shared under the environment URL, in addition to common and site locations. This can be useful in site.html for common interface customization of multiple Trac environments. (since 1.0) | (no default) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `plugins_dir`   | Path to the shared plugins directory. Plugins in that directory are loaded in addition to those in the directory of the environment `plugins`, with this one taking precedence. (since 0.11)                                                                                              | (no default) |
| `templates_dir` | Path to the shared templates directory. Templates in that directory are loaded in addition to those in the environments `templates` directory, but the latter take precedence. (since 0.11)                                                                                               | (no default) |
### [intertrac]
This section configures [InterTrac](/group/rtgwg/InterTrac) prefixes. Options in this section whose name contain a "." define aspects of the [InterTrac](/group/rtgwg/InterTrac) prefix corresponding to the option name up to the ".". Options whose name don't contain a "." define an alias.

The `.url` is mandatory and is used for locating the other Trac. This can be a relative URL in case that Trac environment is located on the same server.

The `.title` information is used for providing a useful tooltip when moving the cursor over an [InterTrac](/group/rtgwg/InterTrac) link.

The `.compat` option can be used to activate or disable a compatibility mode:

- If the targeted Trac is running a version below​0.10 (​r3526 to be precise), then it doesn't know how to dispatch an [InterTrac](/group/rtgwg/InterTrac) link, and it's up to the local Trac to prepare the correct link. Not all links will work that way, but the most common do. This is called the compatibility mode, and is `false` by default.
- If you know that the remote Trac knows how to dispatch [InterTrac](/group/rtgwg/InterTrac) links, you can explicitly disable this compatibility mode and then any [TracLinks](/group/rtgwg/TracLinks) can become [InterTrac](/group/rtgwg/InterTrac) links.
Example configuration:
```
[intertrac]
#-- Example of setting up an alias:
t = trac

#-- Link to an external Trac:
trac.title = Edgewall's Trac for Trac
trac.url = http://trac.edgewall.org
```
### [interwiki]
Every option in the `[interwiki]` section defines one [InterWiki](/group/rtgwg/InterWiki) prefix. The option name defines the prefix. The option value defines the URL, optionally followed by a description separated from the URL by whitespace. Parametric URLs are supported as well.
```
Example:

[interwiki]
MeatBall = http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?
PEP = http://www.python.org/peps/pep-$1.html Python Enhancement Proposal $1
tsvn = tsvn: Interact with TortoiseSvn
```
### [logging]
| `log_file`   | If `log_type` is `file`, this should be a path to the log-file. Relative paths are resolved relative to the `log` directory of the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | trac.log     |

| `log_format` | Custom logging format. If nothing is set, the following will be used: Trac[$(module)s] $(levelname)s: $(message)s In addition to regular key names supported by the Python logger library (seehttp://docs.python.org/library/logging.html), one could use: - $(path)s the path for the current environment - $(basename)s the last path component of the current environment - $(project)s the project name Note the usage of `$(...)s` instead of `%(...)s` as the latter form would be interpreted by the ConfigParser? itself. Example: `($(thread)d) Trac[$(basename)s:$(module)s] $(levelname)s: $(message)s` (since 0.10.5) | (no default) |
|` log_level`  | Level of verbosity in log.

### [milestone]

| `stats_provider` | Name of the component implementing `ITicketGroupStatsProvider`, which is used to collect statistics on groups of tickets for display in the milestone views. | DefaultTicketGroupStatsProvider |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|

### [milestone-groups]
As the workflow for tickets is now configurable, there can be many ticket states, and simply displaying closed tickets vs. all the others is maybe not appropriate in all cases. This section enables one to easily create groups of states that will be shown in different colors in the milestone progress bar.

Note that the groups can only be based on the ticket status, nothing else. In particular, it's not possible to distinguish between different closed tickets based on the resolution.

Example configuration with three groups, closed, new and active (the default only has closed and active):
```
#the 'closed' group correspond to the 'closed' tickets
closed = closed

#.order: sequence number in the progress bar
closed.order = 0

#.query_args: optional parameters for the corresponding query.  In this example, the changes from the default are two additional columns ('created' and 'modified'), and sorting is done on 'created'.
closed.query_args = group=resolution,order=time,col=id,col=summary,col=owner,col=type,col=priority,col=component,col=severity,col=time,col=changetime

#.overall_completion: indicates groups that count for overall completion percentage
closed.overall_completion = true

new = new
new.order = 1
new.css_class = new
new.label = new

#Note: one catch-all group for other statuses is allowed
active = *
active.order = 2

#.css_class: CSS class for this interval
active.css_class = open

#.label: displayed label for this group
active.label = in progress
```
The definition consists in a comma-separated list of accepted status. Also, '*' means any status and could be used to associate all remaining states to one catch-all group.

The CSS class can be one of: new (yellow), open (no color) or closed (green). Other styles can easily be added using custom CSS rule: `table.progress td.< class > { background: < color > }` to a site/style.css file for example.

### [sqlite]
| `extensions` | Paths to sqlite extensions, relative to Trac environment's directory or absolute. (since 0.12) | (no default) |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|

### [svn]
| `branches`  | Comma separated list of paths categorized as branches. If a path ends with '*', then all the directory entries found below that path will be included. Example: `/trunk, /branches/*, /projectAlpha/trunk, /sandbox/*`                       | trunk, branches/* |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `eol_style` | End-of-Line character sequences when `svn:eol-style` property is `native`. If `native` (the default), substitute with the native EOL marker on the server. Otherwise, if `LF`, `CRLF` or `CR`, substitute with the specified EOL marker. (since 1.0.2) | native            |
| `tags`      | Comma separated list of paths categorized as tags. If a path ends with '*', then all the directory entries found below that path will be included. Example: `/tags/*, /projectAlpha/tags/A-1.0, /projectAlpha/tags/A-v1.1`                   | tags/*            |

### [svn:externals]
The [TracBrowser](/group/rtgwg/TracBrowser) for Subversion can interpret the `svn:externals` property of folders. By default, it only turns the URLs into links as Trac can't browse remote repositories.

However, if you have another Trac instance (or an other repository browser like [ViewVC](https://www.viewvc.org/)) configured to browse the target repository, then you can instruct Trac which other repository browser to use for which external URL. This mapping is done in the `[svn:externals]` section of the TracIni.

Example:
```
[svn:externals]
1 = svn://server/repos1                       http://trac/proj1/browser/$path?rev=$rev
2 = svn://server/repos2                       http://trac/proj2/browser/$path?rev=$rev
3 = http://theirserver.org/svn/eng-soft       http://ourserver/viewvc/svn/$path/?pathrev=25914
4 = svn://anotherserver.com/tools_repository  http://ourserver/tracs/tools/browser/$path?rev=$rev
```
With the above, the `svn://anotherserver.com/tools_repository/tags/1.1/tools` external will be mapped to `http://ourserver/tracs/tools/browser/tags/1.1/tools?rev=` (and `rev` will be set to the appropriate revision number if the external additionally specifies a revision, see the [SVN Book](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.externals.html) on externals for more details).

Note that the number used as a key in the above section is purely used as a place holder, as the URLs themselves can't be used as a key due to various limitations in the configuration file parser.

Finally, the relative URLs introduced in [Subversion 1.5](https://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.5.html#externals) are not yet supported.

### [ticket-custom]
In this section, you can define additional fields for tickets. See [TracTicketsCustomFields](/group/rtgwg/TracTicketsCustomFields) for more details.

### [ticket-workflow] 
The workflow for tickets is controlled by plugins. By default, there's only a `ConfigurableTicketWorkflow` component in charge. That component allows the workflow to be configured via this section in the `trac.ini` file. See [TracWorkflow](/group/rtgwg/TracWorkflow) for more details.

Note however that this only applies to the `<deploydir>/htdocs/common` directory, the other deployed resources (i.e. those from plugins) will not be made available this way and additional rewrite rules will be needed in the web server. | (no default)                                                 |

| `use_base_url_for_redirect`   | Optionally use `[trac] base_url` for redirects. In some configurations, usually involving running Trac behind a HTTP proxy, Trac can't automatically reconstruct the URL that is used to access it. You may need to use this option to force Trac to use the `base_url` setting also for redirects. This introduces the obvious limitation that this environment will only be usable when accessible from that URL, as redirects are frequently used.

| `use_xsendfile`               | When true, send a `X-Sendfile` header and no content when sending files from the filesystem, so that the web server handles the content.
