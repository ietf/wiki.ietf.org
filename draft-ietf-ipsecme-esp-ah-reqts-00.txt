 Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance
for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)
                  draft-ietf-ipsec-me-esp-ah-reqts-00

Abstract

   This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to the
   Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH;
   it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these
   algorithms.

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
   (AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to
   provide confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to
   protected data communications in the IP Security (IPsec)
   architecture.  To ensure interoperability between disparate
   implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-
   implement algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of
   mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies
   algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to
   mandatory at some future time, and also recommends against the
   implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is also
   provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security
   goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.

Internet-Draft  Requirements and Guidance for ESP and AH   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and the
   Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] are the mechanisms for applying
   cryptographic protection to data being sent over an IPsec Security
   Association (SA) [RFC4301].

   To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is
   necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.
   This ensures that there is at least one algorithm that all
   implementations will have in common.  This document specifies the
   current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH,
   specifies algorithms that should be implemented because they may be
   promoted to mandatory at some future time, and also recommends
   against the implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage
   guidance is also provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve
   their security goals through appropriate choices of mechanisms.

   The nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface
   continuously and existing algorithms are continuously attacked.  An
   algorithm believed to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak
   tomorrow.  Given this, the choice of mandatory-to-implement algorithm
   should be conservative so as to minimize the likelihood of it being
   compromised quickly.  Thought should also be given to performance
   considerations as many uses of IPsec will be in environments where
   performance is a concern.

   The ESP and AH mandatory-to-implement algorithm(s) may need to change
   over time to adapt to new developments in cryptography.  For this
   reason, the specification of the mandatory-to-implement algorithms is
   not included in the main IPsec, ESP, or AH specifications, but is
   instead placed in this document.  Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement
   algorithm of tomorrow should already be available in most
   implementations of IPsec by the time it is made mandatory.  To
   facilitate this, this document identifies such algorithms, as they
   are known today.  There is no guarantee that the algorithms that we
   believe today may be mandatory in the future will in fact become so.
   All algorithms known today are subject to cryptographic attack and
   may be broken in the future.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Following [RFC4835], we define some additional key words:

Internet-Draft  Requirements and Guidance for ESP and AH   February 2013


   MUST-  This term means the same as MUST.  However, we expect that at
      some point in the future this algorithm will no longer be a MUST.

   SHOULD+  This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is likely
      that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be promoted at some
      future time to be a MUST.

   SHOULD-  This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is likely
      that an algorithm marked as SHOULD- will be deprecated to a MAY or
      worse in a future version of this document.

   SHOULD NOT+  This term means the same as SHOULD NOT.  However, it is
      likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD NOT+ will be deprecated
      to a MUST NOT in a future version of this document.

1.2.  Document History

   This is the initial version of this draft.  It is based on an earlier
   individual submission [draft-mcgrew-ipsec-me-esp-ah-reqts], and
   incorporates feedback provided during the last IPsec ME meeting at
   IETF85.  Triple-DES is now a MAY (instead of SHOULD NOT) and HMAC-MD5
   is now ignored (instead of a SHOULD NOT), and "MAY" is no longer
   called out, except for algorithms that were previously listed as
   SHOULD, SHOULD+, or MUST.

   This revision also adds a section discussing algorithm diversity, and
   references to new work on the selection of future cryptographic
   standards [draft-mcgrew-standby-cipher] and technical work showing
   the insecurity of 64-bit block ciphers (such as the Triple-DES
   algorithm) used to encrypt more than a gigabyte of data [M13].

2.  Implementation Requirements

   This section specifies the cryptographic algorithms that MUST be
   implemented, and provides guidance about ones that SHOULD or SHOULD
   NOT be implemented.

2.1.  ESP Authenticated Encryption (Combined Mode Algorithms)

   ESP combined mode algorithms provide both confidentiality and
   authentication services; in cryptographic terms, these are
   authenticated encryption algorithms [RFC5116].  Authenticated
   encryption transforms are listed in the ESP encryption transforms
   IANA registry.

           Requirement    Authenticated Encryption Algorithm
           -----------    ----------------------------------
           SHOULD+        AES-GCM [RFC4106]
           MAY            AES-CCM [RFC4309]

2.2.  ESP Encryption Algorithms

           Requirement    Encryption Algorithm
           -----------    --------------------------
           MUST           NULL [RFC2410]
           MUST           AES-128-CBC [RFC3602]
           MAY            AES-CTR [RFC3686]
           MAY            TripleDES-CBC [RFC2451]
           SHOULD NOT+    DES-CBC [RFC2405]

2.3.  ESP Authentication Algorithms

           Requirement    Authentication Algorithm (notes)
           -----------    -----------------------------
           MUST           HMAC-SHA1-96 [RFC2404]
           SHOULD+        AES-GMAC [RFC4543]
           SHOULD         AES-XCBC-MAC-96 [RFC3566]
           MAY            NULL [RFC4303]

2.4.  AH Authentication Algorithms

   The requirements for AH are the same as for ESP Authentication
   Algorithms, except that NULL authentication is inapplicable.

3.  Usage Guidance

   Since ESP and AH can be used in several different ways, this note
   provides guidance on the best way to utilize these mechanisms.

   ESP can provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, or the
   combination of both of those security services.  AH provides only
   data origin authentication.  Background information on those security
   services is available [RFC4949].  In the following, we shorten `data
   origin authentication' to `authentication'.

   Both confidentiality and authentication SHOULD be provided.  If
   confidentiality is not needed, then authentication MAY be provided.
   Confidentiality without authentication is not effective [DP07] and
   SHOULD NOT be used.  We describe each of these cases in more detail
   below.

   To provide confidentiality and authentication, an authenticated
   encryption transform SHOULD be used in ESP, in conjunction with NULL
   authentication.  Alternatively, an ESP encryption transform and ESP
   authentication transform MAY be used together (provided that neither
   transform is NULL).  If authentication on the IP header is needed in
   conjunction with confidentiality of higher-layer data, then AH SHOULD
   be used in addition to the transforms recommended above.  It is NOT
   RECOMMENDED to use ESP with NULL authentication in conjunction with
   AH; some configurations of this combination of services have been
   shown to be insecure [PD10].

   To provide authentication without confidentiality, an authentication
   transform MUST be used in either ESP or AH.  It is not possible to
   provide effective confidentiality without authentication, because the
   lack of authentication undermines the efficacy of encryption
   [B96][V02].  An encryption transform MUST NOT be used with a NULL
   authentication transform (unless the encryption transform is an
   authenticated encryption transform).

   Triple-DES SHOULD NOT be used in any scenario in which multiple
   gigabytes of data will be encrypted with a single key.  As a 64-bit
   block cipher, it leaks information about plaintexts above that
   "birthday bound" [M13].  Triple-DES CBC is listed as a MAY implement
   for the sake of backwards compatibility, but its use is discouraged.

4.  Rationale

   This section explains the principles behind the implementation
   requirements described above.

   The algorithms listed as MAY-implement are not meant to be endorsed
   over other non-standard alternatives.  All of the algorithms that
   appeared in [RFC4835] are included in this note, for the sake of
   continuity.  In some cases, these algorithms have moved from being
   SHOULD-implement to MAY-implement algorithms.

4.1.  Authenticated Encryption

   This note encourages the use of authenticated encryption algorithms
   because they can provide significant efficiency and throughput
   advantages, and the tight binding between authentication and
   encryption can be a security advantage [RFC5116].

   AES-GCM [RFC4106] brings significant performance benefits [KKGEGD],
   has been incorporated into IPsec recommendations [RFC6379] and has
   emerged as the preferred authenticated encryption method in IPsec and
   other standards.

4.2.  Encryption Transforms

   Since ESP encryption is optional, support for the "NULL" algorithm is
   required to maintain consistency with the way services are
   negotiated.  Note that while authentication and encryption can each
   be "NULL", they MUST NOT both be "NULL" [RFC4301] [H10].

   AES Counter Mode (AES-CTR) is an efficient encryption method, but it
   provides no authentication capability.  The AES-GCM authenticated
   encryption method has all of the advantages of AES-CTR, while also
   providing authentication.  Thus this note moves AES-CTR from a SHOULD
   to a MAY.

   The Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is obsolete because of its
   small block size; as with all 64-bit block ciphers, it SHOULD NOT be
   used to encrypt more than one gigabyte of data with a single key
   [M13].  Its key size is smaller than that of the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES), while at the same time its performance and efficiency
   is worse.  Thus, its use in new implementations is discouraged.

   The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is obsolete because of its small
   key size and small block size.  There have been publicly demonstrated
   and open-design special-purpose cracking hardware.  Therefore, its
   use is discouraged.

Internet-Draft  Requirements and Guidance for ESP and AH   February 2013


4.3.  Authentication Transforms

   AES-GMAC provides good security along with performance advantages,
   even over HMAC-MD5.  In addition, it uses the same internal
   components as AES-GCM and is easy to implement in a way that shares
   components with that authenticated encryption algorithm.

   The MD5 hash function has been found to not meet its goal of
   collision resistance; it is so weak that its use in digital
   signatures is highly discouraged [RFC6151].  There have been
   theoretical results against HMAC-MD5, but that message authentication
   code does not seem to have a practical vulnerability.  Thus, it may
   not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing protocols.

   SHA-1 has been found to not meet its goal of collision resistance.
   However, HMAC-SHA-1 does not rely on this property, and HMAC-SHA-1 is
   believed to be secure.

   The HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512 are believed to
   provide a good security margin, and they perform adequately on many
   platforms.  However, these algorithms are not recommended for
   implementation in this note, because HMAC-SHA-1 support is widespread
   and its security is good, AES-GMAC provides good security with better
   performance, and Authenticated Encryption algorithms do not need any
   authentication methods.

   AES-XCBC has not seen widespread deployment, despite being previously
   being recommended as a SHOULD+ in RFC4305.  Thus this draft lists it
   only as a SHOULD.

5.  Algorithm Diversity

   When the AES cipher was first adopted, it was decided to continue
   encouraging the implementation of Triple-DES, in order to provide
   algorithm diversity.  But the passage of time has eroded the
   viability of Triple-DES as an alternative to AES.  As it is a 64-bit
   block cipher, its security is inadequate at high data rates (see
   Section 4.2).  Its performance in software and FPGAs is considerably
   worse than that of AES.  Since it would not be possible to use
   Triple-DES as an alternative to AES in high data rate environments,
   or in environments where its performance could not keep up the
   requirements, the rationale of retaining Triple-DES to provide
   algorithm diversity is disappearing.  (Of course, this does not
   change the rationale of retaining Triple-DES in IPsec implementations
   for backwards compability.)

   It may be prudent to begin considering the selection of a different
   cipher that could provide algorithm diversity in IPsec and other IETF
   standards.  There are many important criteria to consider, which are
   out of scope for this note.  These issues have been taken up in
   recent work [draft-mcgrew-standby-cipher].

   It is important to bear in mind that it is very highly unlikely that
   an exploitable flaw will be found in AES (e.g., a flaw that required
   less than a terabyte of known plaintext, when AES is used in a
   conventional mode of operation).  The only reason that algorithm
   diversity deserves any consideration is because the problems that
   would be caused if such a flaw were found would be so large.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security of a system that uses cryptography depends on both the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of
   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on
   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system
   to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the
   security of the overall system.

   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with the selection
   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known
   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far
   leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this is not necessarily forever.  We
   would therefore expect that new revisions of this document will be
   issued from time to time that reflect the current best practice in
   this area.
