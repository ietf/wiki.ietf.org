## Note well
All contribututions to this wiki are covered by the [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) and the various policies to which it refers. Please review it carefully as it covers topics such as the [IETF Guidelines for Conduct (BCP 54)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7154.html), [Copyright (BCP 78)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5378.html), and [Intellectual Property Rights (BCP 79)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8179.html).

## General principles

Inspired by the [Ten simple rules for editing Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ten_simple_rules_for_editing_Wikipedia), here are some general principles to consider when contributing to the IETF Community wiki:

1. **Consider how your contribution could help the IETF community work better.** Anyone who has an [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org) account and contributes ideas to the IETF is part of the IETF community. If you contribute to this wiki, you are part of that community.

1.  **Remember this wiki serves the IETF.** This wiki is a shared resource intended to serve the groups, meetings, and other activities within the IETF Community. While the IETF covers many aspects of Internet technologies, it is guided by its [mission and principles](https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/), and there are many topics that are out of scope for the IETF.

1. **Be empowered to add, update or change information, especially when you know it is out of date.** This wiki contains a wide range of information and is mostly maintained by voluteer effort, so information may sometimes get stale. You can peek at the history (found at: https://wiki.ietf.org/h/PAGNAME) to see when a page has been updated. Of course, you should have reliable sources for the updated information and provide links when possible. And it is always good to keep in mind the [priniciple of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). Finally, if you have serious question about a page, feel free to ask a question (see below).

1. **Ask for help or guidance if you have a question.** The IETF Community wiki is an evolving resource so it is always OK to ask a question if you are not quite sure of something. In general you should feel free to send any question to [support@ietf.org](mailt:support@ietf.org) and the IETF Secretariat will ensure the question is answered or forwarded to folks who can answer it. Sometimes a more direct approach can work, for example if question relates to a specific [group wiki](/group), you might consider sending the question to the chair or leadership of that group.
