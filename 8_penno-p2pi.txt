Abstract 

   The use of P2P protocols by end users is widespread. These protocols 
   are meant to exchange, replicate, stream or download files with 
   little human intervention, trying at the same time to minimize the 
   download time of the files requested by any single peer. The ubiquity 
   of such P2P networks has created a steep rise in subscriber bandwidth

1. Introduction 

   The use of P2P protocols by end users is widespread. These protocols 
   are meant to exchange, replicate, stream or download files with 
   little human intervention, trying at the same time to minimize the 
   download time of the files requested by any single peer. This is done 
   by opening several connections to multiple peers and downloading one 
   or more chunks of the file from each one, selecting faster peers, 
   amongst others.  

   The availability of large amounts of content hosted by distributed 
   peers across the globe coupled with the fact that once downloads are 
   scheduled the clients pretty much run on their own, created a change 
   in data traffic patterns.

   Now end users that utilize P2P clients in general not only consume 
   more bandwidth but consume bandwidth throughout the whole day, and 
   more specifically consume more upstream bandwidth since they share 
   files, and more downstream bandwidth since P2P clients try to 
   minimize download time.  

   Given that ISP networks were planned for different traffic patterns, 
   this surge in bandwidth consumption created several problems such as 
   congestion, delays, unfairness between end users and a spike in 
   inter-ISP transit costs. 

   In this document we will discuss the status and requirements for 
   solutions tackling this problem.  

2. Terminology 

   Cache - A IP Host that holds a copy of an original content 

   End user - A IP host running P2P applications, e.g., P2P client  

   NSIS - Next Steps in Signaling 

   P2P - Peer to Peer 

   Peer - Any IP host that joins a P2P network to share or download 
   content 

   Rendezvous Point - A host in a P2P network that collects and 
   disseminates peer information.   

   Subscriber - Used interchangeably with end user. Although a broadband 
   subscriber as a paying entity can encompass many end users  

3. P2P Conflicting Interests 

   Any P2P solution needs to juggle three different sets of interests. 
   End users want to maximize their bandwidth consumption to receive 
   downloads faster and upload files to others peers with privacy. The 
   ISPs want to manage and provide a fair share for each subscriber in 
   an economic viable way.  

   Finally, more recently content distributors are also utilizing P2P as 
   a means to economically distribute content or services in a cost 
   effective redundant manner. For this reason the requirements of 
   content owners or distributors need to be taken into account when 
   finding a solution for P2P in ISP networks.

4. P2P clients and Network 

   When it comes to interactions between P2P clients and the network, 
   there are a number of possible ways to deal with the problem such as: 

   o  ISPs can take unilateral actions such as throttle or tear down P2P 
      or transport sessions as whole for each subscriber, or place 
      caches strategically in the network, 

   o  P2P clients can also take actions unilaterally such as react to 
      congestion or delay in the network, 

   o  P2P clients can make use of rendezvous points located within the 
      ISP's network  

   o  Or finally, P2P clients and the network can exchange information 
      through policies or signaling. 

   Policies could be divided in two classes: session dependent and 
   independent. Session dependent policies can change from session to 
   session and can be a result of the client signaling for bandwidth on 
   a per session basis using an existing protocol such as NSIS. 
    
   Session Independent polices have longer time spans and are a result 
   of network wide provisioning. For example, an ISP can have a list of 
   networks that the clients could give preference when selecting peers. 
   Such exchange of information could be done independent of the P2P 
   protocol. 

5. P2P Dynamic Nature 

   There are many issues that contribute to the dynamic nature of the 
   problem: 

   o  The number of established and dynamic sessions to other peers and 
      rendezvous points, 

   o  Bandwidth consumption that depends not only on the originating 
      ISP, but terminating ISP and other peer's client configuration, 

   o  The different protocol implementations and variations or extension 
      within the same protocol 

   o  The distributed nature of P2P protocols usually implies that there 
      is no effective single point of control for the providers

   o  Flash crowds are common since new popular content can become 
      available and spread quickly. 

   So, any protocol that signals session dependent policies needs to be 
   quite scalable, and session independent policy should have longer 
   time spans when compared with time taken to download a large file. 

6. Caches 

   One of the mechanisms that is an option to ISPs and can be deployed 
   independent of clients is that of strategically placed caches. 

   Caches from a HTTP perspective are well understood [8][9]. There are 
   many studies on web workload, both on real networks of diverse 
   architectures and simulations. Moreover, Web follows a client-server 
   model where many clients try to access a limited number of servers. 
    
   In P2P the number of servers is not limited and could be any or all 
   of the peers; while total number of files might be very large, the 
   number of popular files is usually observed to be limited. 
    
   The number of studies today in the area of P2P caching in real 
   diverse networks is limited and although it is a promising area and 
   intuitively caches can definitely help mitigate the bandwidth issue, 
   it remains to be seen the economic viability in terms actual hit 
   ratio and bandwidth savings vs. necessary storage and price. 

7. Rendezvous Points 

   Rendezvous points are hosts that store and disseminate information 
   amongst P2P clients such as which clients are active, their current 
   shared files, bandwidth consumption, amongst others and in some cases 
   help P2P clients join a P2P network (although these two 
   functionalities can be done by different hosts). Depending on the P2P 
   network these rendezvous points have different functionalities and 
   are called supernodes, servers, ultrapeers or trackers. 

   Although the specifics of Rendezvous Points are different for each 
   P2P protocol, a protocol agnostic version could help alleviate P2P 
   bandwidth related issues through a smart peer selection.  

8. High Availability 

   It is also worth noting that P2P is a desirable technology for 
   content owners and distributors because P2P provides both high 
   availability and redundancy since content is distributed throughout 
   the Internet as opposed to individual data centers or servers.

9. Security Considerations 

   There are many possible attacks on P2P networks. For the specific 
   solutions discussed, if ISP and P2P clients are to exchange 
   information in whatever manner the most relevant ones would be 
   related to the channel between P2P client and network. A non-
   exhaustive list would be rendezvous point poisoning, rendezvous point 
   spoofing and network policy spoofing or poisoning.    

10. IANA Considerations 

   None at this time. 

11. Conclusions 

   From a technical standpoint there are many possible ways to tackle 
   the P2P problem. It remains to be seen in real networks which 
   combination of combination of caches, P2P signaling or provisioning 
   protocol or rendezvous points is going to be the solution.  

   From an IETF perspective if the goal is standardization, working on 
   solutions that are protocol agnostic is probably the way to move 
   forward given the history on the number of P2P protocols and 
   variations. Interception use of caches, network provisioning, and 
   others should probably be captured in a BCP.
