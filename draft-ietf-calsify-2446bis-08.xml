      <t>
        This document specifies a protocol using the iCalendar object specification to provide scheduling interoperability between different calendaring systems. This is done without reference to a specific transport protocol so as to allow multiple methods of communication between systems. Subsequent documents will define profiles of this protocol using specific interoperable methods of communications between systems. 
      </t>
      <t>
        iTIP complements the iCalendar object specification by adding semantics for group scheduling methods commonly available in current calendaring systems. These scheduling methods permit two or more calendaring systems to perform transactions such as publish, schedule, reschedule, respond to scheduling requests, negotiation of changes or cancel.

    <section title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t>
        This document specifies how calendaring systems use 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis">
          iCalendar
        </xref>
        objects to interoperate with other calendaring systems. In particular, it specifies how to schedule events, to-dos, or daily journal entries. It further specifies how to search for available busy time information. It does so in a general way without specifying how communication between different systems actually takes place. Subsequent documents specify transport bindings between systems that use this protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        This protocol is based on messages sent from an originator to one or more recipients. For certain types of messages, a recipient may reply, in order to update their status and may also return transaction/request status information. The protocol supports the ability for the message originator to modify or cancel the original message. The protocol also supports the ability for recipients to suggest changes to the originator of a message. The elements of the protocol also define the user roles for its transactions.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification obsoletes RFC 2446 - a list of important changes is provided in Appendix A.

      <section title="Formatting Conventions">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
          <xref target="RFC2119" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          Calendaring and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" (CU) within the scheduling protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
          Calendar components defined by 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis" />
          are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start with the letter "V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily journal calendar component.
        </t>
        <t>
          Scheduling methods are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.
        </t>
        <t>
          Properties defined by 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis" />
          are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example, "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey the calendar address of a "Calendar User".
        </t>
        <t>
          Property parameters defined by this specification are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "parameter". For example, "VALUE" parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override the default data type for a property value.
        </t>
        <t>
          Enumerated values defined by this specification are referred to with capitalized text, either alone or followed by the word "value".
        </t>
        <t>
          In tables, the quoted-string text is specified without quotes in order to minimize the table length.

      <section title="Roles">
        <t>
          Exchanges of iCalendar objects for the purposes of group calendaring and scheduling occur between "Calendar Users" (CUs). CUs take on several roles in iTIP:

          </c>
          <c>
            The CU who initiates an exchange takes on the role of "Organizer". For example, the CU who proposes a group meeting is the "Organizer".

            Attendee
          </c>
          <c>
            CUs who are included in the scheduling message as possible recipients of that scheduling message. For example, the CUs asked to participate in a group meeting by the "Organizer" take on the role of "Attendee".

        </texttable>
        <t>
          Note that "ROLE" is also a descriptive parameter to the iCalendar "ATTENDEE" property. Its use is to convey descriptive context about an "Attendee" such as "chair", "required participant" or "non-required participant" and has nothing to do with the calendaring workflow.

    <section title="Interoperability Models">
      <t>
        There are two distinct protocols relevant to interoperability: an "Application Protocol" and a "Transport Protocol". The Application Protocol defines the content of the iCalendar objects sent between sender and receiver to accomplish the scheduling transactions listed above. The Transport Protocol defines how the iCalendar objects are sent between the sender and receiver. This document focuses on the Application Protocol. Binding documents such as 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis" />
        focus on the Transport Protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        The connection between Sender and Receiver in the diagram below refers to the Application Protocol. The iCalendar objects passed from the Sender to the Receiver are presented in Section 3, Application Protocol Elements.

      <section title="Application Protocol">
        <t>
          In the iTIP model, an iCalendar object is created and managed by an "Organizer". The "Organizer" interacts with other CUs by sending one or more of the iTIP messages listed above. "Attendees" use the "REPLY" method to communicate their status. "Attendees" do not make direct changes to the master iCalendar object. They can, however, use the "COUNTER" method to suggest changes to the "Organizer". In any case, the "Organizer" has complete control over the master iCalendar object.
        </t>
        <section title="Scheduling State">
          <t>
            There are two distinct states relevant to iCalendar objects used in scheduling: the overall state of the iCalendar object and the state associated with an "Attendee" in that iCalendar object.
          </t>
          <t>
            The state of an iCalendar object is defined by the "STATUS" property and is controlled by the "Organizer." There is no default value for the "STATUS" property. The "Organizer" sets the "STATUS" property to the appropriate value for each iCalendar object.
          </t>
          <t>
            The state of a particular "Attendee" relative to a iCalendar object used for scheduling is defined by the "PARTSTAT" parameter in the "ATTENDEE" property for each "Attendee". When an "Organizer" issues the initial iCalendar object, "Attendee" status is typically unknown. The "Organizer" specifies this by setting the "PARTSTAT" parameter to "NEEDS-ACTION". Each "Attendee" modifies their "ATTENDEE" property "PARTSTAT" parameter to an appropriate value as part of a "REPLY" message sent back to the "Organizer".
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Delegation">
          <t>
            Delegation is defined as the process by which an "Attendee" grants another CU (or several CUs) the right to attend on their behalf. The "Organizer" is made aware of this change because the delegating "Attendee" informs the "Organizer". These steps are detailed in the REQUEST method section.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acting on Behalf of other Calendar Users">
          <t>
            In many organizations one user will act on behalf of another to organize and/or respond to meeting requests. ITIP provides two mechanisms that support these activities.
          </t>
          <t>
            First, the "Organizer" is treated as a special entity, separate from "Attendees". All responses from "Attendees" flow to the "Organizer", making it easy to separate a calendar user organizing a meeting from calendar users attending the meeting. Additionally, iCalendar provides descriptive roles for each "Attendee". For instance, a role of "chair" may be ascribed to one or more "Attendees". The "chair" and the "Organizer" may or may not be the same calendar user. This maps well to scenarios where an assistant may manage meeting logistics for another individual who chairs a meeting.
          </t>
          <t>
            Second, a "SENT-BY" parameter may be specified in either the "Organizer" or "Attendee" properties. When specified, the "SENT-BY" parameter indicates that the responding CU acted on behalf of the specified "Attendee" or "Organizer".
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Component Revisions">
          <t>The "SEQUENCE" property is used by the "Organizer" to indicate revisions to the calendar component. When the "Organizer" makes changes to one of the following properties, the sequence number MUST be incremented:</t>
          <t>
          <list style="symbols">
          	<t>"DTSTART"</t>
          	<t>"DTEND"</t>
          	<t>"DURATION"</t>
          	<t>"DUE"</t>
          	<t>"RRULE"</t>
          	<t>"RDATE"</t>
          	<t>"EXDATE"</t>
          	<t>"STATUS"</t>
          </list>
          </t>
          <t>
			In addition, changes made by the "Organizer" to other properties MAY also require the sequence number to be incremented. The "Organizer" CUA MUST increment the sequence number whenever it makes changes to properties in the calendar component that the "Organizer" deems will jeopardize the validity of the participation status of the "Attendees". For example, changing the location of a meeting from one location to another distant location could effectively impact the participation status of the "Attendees".
          </t>
          <t>
            Depending on the "METHOD", the "SEQUENCE" property MUST follow these rules in the context of iTIP:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                For the "PUBLISH" and "REQUEST" methods, the "SEQUENCE" property value is incremented according to the rules stated above.

                The "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be incremented each time the "Organizer" uses the "ADD" or "CANCEL" methods.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
              </t>
              <t>
                The "SEQUENCE" property value MUST NOT be incremented when using "REPLY", "REFRESH", "COUNTER", "DECLINECOUNTER", or when sending a delegation "REQUEST".

          <t>
            In some circumstances the "Organizer" may not have received responses to the final revision sent out. In this situation, the "Organizer" may wish to send an update "REQUEST", and set "RSVP=TRUE" for all "Attendees", so that current responses can be collected.
          </t>
          <t>
            The value of the "SEQUENCE" property contained in a response from an "Attendee" may not always match the "Organizer's" revision. Implementations may choose to have the CUA indicate to the CU that the response is to an iCalendar object that has been revised and allow the CU to decide whether or not to accept the response.
          </t>
          <t>
            Whilst a change in sequence number is indicative of a significant change to a previously scheduled item, "Attendee" CUAs SHOULD NOT rely solely on a change in sequence number as a means of detecting a significant change. Instead CUAs SHOULD compare the old and new versions of the calendar components and determine the exact nature of the changes and make decisions, possibly based on calendar user preferences, as to whether the user needs to be explicitly informed of the change.

          <t>
            CUAs that handle the iTIP application protocol must often correlate a component in a calendar store with a component received in the iTIP message. For example, an event may be updated with a later revision of the same event. To accomplish this, a CUA must correlate the version of the event already in its calendar store with the version sent in the iTIP message. In addition to this correlation, there are several factors that can cause iTIP messages to arrive in an unexpected order. That is, an "Organizer" could receive a reply to an earlier revision of a component AFTER receiving a reply to a later revision.
          </t>
          <t>
            To maximize interoperability and to handle messages that arrive in an unexpected order, use the following rules:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                The primary key for referencing a particular iCalendar component is the "UID" property value. To reference an instance of a recurring component, the primary key is composed of the "UID" and the "RECURRENCE-ID" properties.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
              </t>
              <t>
                The secondary key for referencing a component is the "SEQUENCE" property value. For components where the "UID" and "RECURRENCE-ID" property values are the same, the component with the highest numeric value for the "SEQUENCE" property obsoletes all other revisions of the component with lower values.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
              </t>
              <t>
                "Attendees" send "REPLY" messages to the "Organizer". For replies where the "UID" and "RECURRENCE-ID" property values are the same, the value of the "SEQUENCE" property indicates the revision of the component to which the "Attendee" is replying. The reply with the highest numeric value for the "SEQUENCE" property obsoletes all other replies with lower values.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
              </t>
              <t>
                In situations where the "UID", "RECURRENCE-ID", and "SEQUENCE" property values match, the "DTSTAMP" property is used as the tie-breaker. The component with the latest "DTSTAMP" overrides all others. Similarly, for "Attendee" responses where the "UID", "RECURRENCE-ID", and "SEQUENCE" property values match, the response with the latest "DTSTAMP" overrides all others.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            Hence, CUAs will need to persist the following component properties in order to correctly process iTIP messages: "UID", "RECURRENCE-ID", "SEQUENCE", and "DTSTAMP". Furthermore, for each "ATTENDEE" property of a component, "Organizer" CUAs will need to persist the "SEQUENCE" and "DTSTAMP" property values associated with the "Attendee's" last response, so that any earlier responses from an "Attendee" that are received out of order (e.g., due to a delay in the transport) can be correctly discarded.

        ITIP messages are "text/calendar" MIME entities that contain calendaring and scheduling information. The particular type of iCalendar message is referred to as the "method type". Each method type is identified by a "METHOD" property specified as part of the "text/calendar" content type. The table below shows various combinations of calendar components and the method types that this specification supports.

        Each method type is defined in terms of its associated components and properties. Some components and properties are required, some are optional and others are excluded. The restrictions are expressed in this document using a simple "restriction table". The first column indicates the name of a component or property. Properties of the iCalendar object are not indented. Properties of a component are indented. The second column (the "Presence" column) indicates whether a component or property should be present or not, and if present how many times it can occur. The third column contains comments for further clarification.
      </t>
        <t>
          The presence column uses the following values to assert whether a property is required, is optional and the number of times it may appear in the iCalendar object.

            The "PUBLISH" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is an unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object. Any CU may add published components to their calendar. The "Organizer" MUST be present in a published iCalendar component. "Attendees" MUST NOT be present. Its expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary event as an iCalendar object. The "Organizer" may subsequently update (with another "PUBLISH" method), add instances to (with an "ADD" method), or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a previously published "VEVENT" calendar component.
          </t>

            This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the following property constraints:

            The "REQUEST" method in a "VEVENT" component provides the following scheduling functions:
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                Invite "Attendees" to an event
              </t>
              <t>
                Reschedule an existing event
              </t>
              <t>
                Response to a REFRESH request
              </t>
              <t>
                Update the details of an existing event, without rescheduling it
              </t>
              <t>
                Update the status of "Attendees" of an existing event, without rescheduling it
              </t>
              <t>
                Reconfirm an existing event, without rescheduling it
              </t>
              <t>
                Forward a "VEVENT" to another uninvited CU
              </t>
              <t>
                For an existing "VEVENT" calendar component, delegate the role of "Attendee" to another CU
              </t>
              <t>
                For an existing "VEVENT" calendar component, changing the role of "Organizer" to another CU
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            The "Organizer" originates the "REQUEST". The recipients of the "REQUEST" method are the CUs invited to the event, the "Attendees". "Attendees" use the "REPLY" method to convey attendance status to the "Organizer".
          </t>
          <t>
            The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the various uses of the "REQUEST" method. If the "UID" property value in the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the "REQUEST" is for a new "VEVENT" calendar component. If the "UID" property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then the "REQUEST" is for a rescheduling, an update, or a reconfirm of the "VEVENT" calendar component.
          </t>
          <t>
            For the "REQUEST" method, multiple "VEVENT" components in a single iCalendar object are only permitted when for components with the same "UID" property. That is, a series of recurring events may have instance-specific information. In this case, multiple "VEVENT" components are needed to express the entire series.
          </t>

            This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the following property constraints:

          <section title="Rescheduling an Event">
            <t>
              The "REQUEST" method may be used to reschedule an event. A rescheduled event involves a change to the existing event in terms of its time or recurrence intervals and possibly the location or description. If the recipient CUA of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID" property value already exists on the calendar, but that the "SEQUENCE" (or "DTSTAMP") property value in the "REQUEST" method is greater than the value for the existing event, then the "REQUEST" method describes a rescheduling of the event.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Updating or Reconfirmation of an Event">
            <t>
              The "REQUEST" method may be used to update or reconfirm an event. An update to an existing event does not involve changes to the time or recurrence intervals, and might not involve a change to the location or description for the event. If the recipient CUA of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID" property value already exists on the calendar and that the "SEQUENCE" property value in the "REQUEST" is the same as the value for the existing event, then the "REQUEST" method describes an update of the event details, but no rescheduling of the event.
            </t>
            <t>
              The update "REQUEST" method is the appropriate response to a "REFRESH" method sent from an "Attendee" to the "Organizer" of an event.
            </t>
            <t>
              The "Organizer" of an event may also send unsolicited "REQUEST" methods. The unsolicited "REQUEST" methods may be used to update the details of the event without rescheduling it, to update the "PARTSTAT" parameter of "Attendees", or to reconfirm the event.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Delegating an Event to another CU">
            <t>
              Some calendar and scheduling systems allow "Attendees" to delegate their presence at an event to another calendar user. ITIP supports this concept using the following workflow. Any "Attendee" may delegate their right to participate in a calendar VEVENT to another CU. The implication is that the delegate participates in lieu of the original "Attendee"; NOT in addition to the "Attendee". The delegator MUST notify the "Organizer" of this action using the steps outlined below. Implementations may support or restrict delegation as they see fit. For instance, some implementations may restrict a delegate from delegating a "REQUEST" to another CU.
            </t>
            <t>
              The "Delegator" of an event forwards the existing "REQUEST" to the "Delegate". The "REQUEST" method MUST include an "ATTENDEE" property with the calendar address of the "Delegate". The "Delegator" MUST also send a "REPLY" method to the "Organizer" with the "Delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property "PARTSTAT" parameter value set to "DELEGATED". In addition, the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter MUST be included with the calendar address of the "Delegate". Also, a new "ATTENDEE" property for the "Delegate" MUST be included and must specify the calendar user address set in the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter, as above.
            </t>
            <t>
              In response to the request, the "Delegate" MUST send a "REPLY" method to the "Organizer" and optionally, to the "Delegator". The "REPLY" method SHOULD include the "ATTENDEE" property with the "DELEGATED-FROM" parameter value of the "Delegator's" calendar address.
            </t>
            <t>
              The "Delegator" may continue to receive updates to the event even though they will not be attending. This is accomplished by the "Delegator" setting their "role" attribute to " NON-PARTICIPANT" in the "REPLY" to the "Organizer"
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Changing the Organizer">
            <t>
              The situation may arise where the "Organizer" of a VEVENT is no longer able to perform the "Organizer" role and abdicates without passing on the "Organizer" role to someone else. When this occurs the "Attendees" of the VEVENT may use out-of-band mechanisms to communicate the situation and agree upon a new "Organizer". The new "Organizer" should then send out a new "REQUEST" with a modified version of the VEVENT in which the "SEQUENCE" number has been incremented and the "ORGANIZER" property has been changed to the new "Organizer".
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Sending on Behalf of the Organizer">
            <t>
              There are a number of scenarios that support the need for a calendar user to act on behalf of the "Organizer" without explicit role changing. This might be the case if the CU designated as "Organizer" was sick or unable to perform duties associated with that function. In these cases iTIP supports the notion of one CU acting on behalf of another. Using the "SENT-BY" parameter, a calendar user could send an updated "VEVENT" REQUEST. In the case where one CU sends on behalf of another CU, the "Attendee" responses are still directed back towards the CU designated as "Organizer".
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Forwarding to An Uninvited CU">
            <t>
              An "Attendee" invited to an event may invite another uninvited CU to the event. The invited "Attendee" accomplishes this by forwarding the original "REQUEST" method to the uninvited CU. The uninvited CU then replies to the "Organizer". The "Organizer" decides whether or not the uninvited CU is added to the attendee list. If the "Organizer" decides not to add the uninvited CU no further action is required, however the "Organizer" MAY send the uninvited CU a "CANCEL" message. If the "Organizer" decides to add an uninvited CU, a new "ATTENDEE" property is added for the uninvited CU with its property parameters set as the "Organizer" deems appropriate. When forwarding a "REQUEST" to another CU, the forwarding "Attendee" MUST NOT make changes to the original message.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Updating Attendee Status">
            <t>
              The "Organizer" of an event may also request updated status from one or more "Attendees. The "Organizer" sends a "REQUEST" method to the "Attendee" and sets the "ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE" property parameter. The "SEQUENCE" property for the event is not changed from its previous value. A recipient will determine that the only change in the "REQUEST" is that their "RSVP" property parameter indicates a request for updated status. The recipient SHOULD respond with a "REPLY" method indicating their current status with respect to the "REQUEST".
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="REPLY">
          <t>
            The "REPLY" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used to respond (e.g., accept or decline) to a "REQUEST" or to reply to a delegation "REQUEST". When used to provide a delegation response, the "Delegator" SHOULD include the calendar address of the "Delegate" on the "DELEGATED-TO" property parameter of the "Delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property. The "Delegate" SHOULD include the calendar address of the "Delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" property parameter of the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "REPLY" method is also used when processing of a "REQUEST" fails. Depending on the value of the "REQUEST-STATUS" property no scheduling action may have been performed.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "Organizer" of an event may receive the "REPLY" method from a CU not in the original "REQUEST". For example, a "REPLY" may be received from a "Delegate" to an event. In addition, the "REPLY" method may be received from an unknown CU (a "Party Crasher"). This uninvited "Attendee" may be accepted, or the "Organizer" may cancel the event for the uninvited "Attendee" by sending a "CANCEL" method to the uninvited "Attendee".
          </t>
          <t>
            An "Attendee" MAY include a message to the "Organizer" using the "COMMENT" property. For example, if the user indicates tentative acceptance and wants to let the "Organizer" know why, the reason can be expressed in the "COMMENT" property value.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "Organizer" may also receive a "REPLY" from one CU on behalf of another. Like the scenario enumerated above for the "Organizer", "Attendees" may have another CU respond on their behalf. This is done using the "SENT-BY" parameter.
          </t>
          <t>
            The optional properties listed in the table below (those listed as "0+" or "0 or 1") MUST NOT be changed from those of the original request. If property changes are desired the COUNTER message must be used.

          <t>
            The "ADD" method allows the "Organizer" to add one or more new instances to an existing "VEVENT" using a single ITIP message without having to send the entire "VEVENT" with all the existing instance data, as it would have to do if the "REQUEST" method were used.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "UID" must be that of the existing event. If the "UID" property value in the "ADD" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the recipient SHOULD send a "REFRESH" to the "Organizer" in order to be updated with the latest version of the "VEVENT". If an "Attendee" implementation does not support the "ADD" method it should respond with a "REQUEST-STATUS" value of 3.14 and ask for a "REFRESH".

            The "CANCEL" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used to send a cancellation notice of an existing event request to the affected "Attendees". The message is sent by the "Organizer" of the event. For a recurring event, either the whole event or instances of an event may be cancelled. To cancel the complete range of recurring event, the "UID" property value for the event MUST be specified and a "RECURRENCE-ID" MUST NOT be specified in the "CANCEL" method. In order to cancel an individual instance of the event, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value for the event MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are two options for canceling a sequence of instances of a recurring "VEVENT" calendar component: 
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="letters">
              <t>
                the "RECURRENCE-ID" property for an instance in the sequence MUST be specified with the "RANGE" property parameter value of "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate cancellation of the specified "VEVENT" calendar component and all instances after; or
              </t>
              <t>
                individual recurrence instances may be cancelled by specifying multiple "VEVENT" components each with a "RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to one of the instances to be cancelled.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            When a "VEVENT" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be incremented.
          </t>

            The "REFRESH" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used by "Attendees" of an existing event to request an updated description from the event "Organizer". The "REFRESH" method must specify the "UID" property of the event to update. A recurrence instance of an event may be requested by specifying the "RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to the associated event. The "Organizer" responds with the latest description and version of the event.

            The "COUNTER" method for a "VEVENT" calendar component is used by an "Attendee" of an existing event to submit to the "Organizer" a counter proposal to the event. The "Attendee" sends this message to the "Organizer" of the event.
          </t>
          <t>
            The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a VEVENT calendar component describing the complete description of the alternate event.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the "Attendee" a VEVENT "DECLINECOUNTER" method. The "Organizer" accepts the counter proposal by rescheduling the event as described in section 3.2.2.1 Rescheduling an Event.

      <section title="Methods For VFREEBUSY Components">
        <t>
          This section defines the property set for the methods that are applicable to the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. Each of the methods is defined using a restriction table.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document only addresses the transfer of busy time information. Applications desiring free time information MUST infer this from available busy time information.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "FREEBUSY" property value MAY include a list of values, separated by the COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44). Alternately, multiple busy time periods MAY be specified with multiple instances of the "FREEBUSY" property. Both forms MUST be supported by implementations conforming to this document. Duplicate busy time periods SHOULD NOT be specified in an iCalendar object. However, two different busy time periods MAY overlap.
        </t>
        <t>
          "FREEBUSY" properties SHOULD be sorted such that their values are in ascending order, based on the start time, and then the end time, with the earliest periods first. For example, today's busy time information should appear after yesterday's busy time information. And the busy time for this half-hour should appear after the busy time for earlier today. Busy time periods may also span a day boundary.
        </t>
        <t>
          The following summarizes the methods that are defined for the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.

          <t>
            The "PUBLISH" method in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is used to publish busy time data. The method may be sent from one CU to any other. The purpose of the method is to provide a way to send unsolicited busy time data. That is, the busy time data is not being sent as a "REPLY" to the receipt of a "REQUEST" method.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "ORGANIZER" property MUST be specified in the busy time information. The value is the CU address of the originator of the busy time information.
          </t>
        <t>
          The busy time information within the iCalendar object MAY be grouped into more than one "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. This capability allows busy time periods to be grouped according to some common periodicity, such as a calendar week, month, or year. In this case, each "VFREEBUSY" calendar component MUST include the "ORGANIZER", "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties in order to specify the source of the busy time information and the date and time interval over which the busy time information covers.
        </t>
          <t>
            This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the following property constraints:

            The "REQUEST" method in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is used to ask a "Calendar User" for their busy time information. The request may be for a busy time information bounded by a specific date and time interval.
          </t>
          <t>
            This message only permits requests for busy time information. The message is sent from a "Calendar User" requesting the busy time information to one or more intended recipients.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the originator of the "REQUEST" method is not authorized to make a busy time request on the recipient's calendar system, then an exception message SHOULD be returned in a "REPLY" method, but no busy time data need be returned.

          <t>
            The "PUBLISH" method in a "VTODO" calendar component has no associated response. It is simply a posting of an iCalendar object that maybe added to a calendar. It MUST have an "Organizer". It MUST NOT have "Attendees". Its expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary "VTODO" calendar component as an iCalendar object. The "Organizer" MAY subsequently update (with another "PUBLISH" method), add instances to (with an "ADD" method), or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a previously published "VTODO" calendar component.
          </t>
          <t>
            This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the following property constraints:

        <section title="REQUEST">
          <t>
            The "REQUEST" method in a "VTODO" calendar component provides the following scheduling functions:
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                Assign a to-do to one or more "Calendar Users"
              </t>
              <t>
                Reschedule an existing to-do
              </t>
              <t>
                Update the details of an existing to-do, without rescheduling it
              </t>
              <t>
                Update the completion status of "Attendees" of an existing to-do, without rescheduling it
              </t>
              <t>
                Reconfirm an existing to-do, without rescheduling it
              </t>
              <t>
                Delegate/reassign an existing to-do to another "Calendar User"
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            The assigned "Calendar Users" are identified in the "VTODO" calendar component by individual "ATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT" property value sequences.
          </t>
          <t>
            Typically the originator of a "REQUEST" is the "Organizer" of the to-do, and the recipient of a "REQUEST" is the "Calendar User" assigned the to-do. The "Attendee" uses the "REPLY" method to convey their acceptance and completion status to the "Organizer" of the "REQUEST".
          </t>
          <t>
            The "UID", "SEQUENCE", and "DTSTAMP" properties are used to distinguish the various uses of the "REQUEST" method. If the "UID" property value in the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the "REQUEST" is for a new to-do. If the "UID" property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then the "REQUEST" is a rescheduling, an update, or a reconfirm of the "VTODO" calendar object.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the "Organizer" of the "REQUEST" method is not authorized to make a to-do request on the "Attendee's" calendar system, then an exception is returned in the "REQUEST-STATUS" property of a subsequent "REPLY" method, but no scheduling action is performed.
          </t>
          <t>
            For the "REQUEST" method, multiple "VTODO" components in a single iCalendar object are only permitted when for components with the same "UID" property. That is, a series of recurring events may have instance-specific information. In this case, multiple "VTODO" components are needed to express the entire series.
          </t>
          <t>
            This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the following property constraints:

          <section title="REQUEST for Rescheduling a VTODO">
            <t>
              The "REQUEST" method may be used to reschedule a "VTODO" calendar component.
            </t>
            <t>
              Rescheduling a "VTODO" calendar component involves a change to the existing "VTODO" calendar component in terms of its start or due time or recurrence intervals and possibly the description. If the recipient CUA of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID" property value already exists on the calendar, but that the "SEQUENCE" property value in the "REQUEST" is greater than the value for the existing VTODO, then the "REQUEST" method describes a rescheduling of the "VTODO" calendar component.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="REQUEST for Update or Reconfirmation of a VTODO">
            <t>
              The "REQUEST" method may be used to update or reconfirm a "VTODO" calendar component. Reconfirmation is merely an update of "Attendee" completion status or overall "VTODO" calendar component status.
            </t>
            <t>
              An update to an existing "VTODO" calendar component does not involve changes to the start or due time or recurrence intervals, nor generally to the description for the "VTODO" calendar component. If the recipient CUA of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID" property value already exists on the calendar and that the "SEQUENCE" property value in the "REQUEST" is the same as the value for the existing event, then the "REQUEST" method describes an update of the "VTODO" calendar component details, but not a rescheduling of the "VTODO" calendar component.
            </t>
            <t>
              The update "REQUEST" is the appropriate response to a "REFRESH" method sent from an "Attendee" to the "Organizer" of a "VTODO" calendar component.
            </t>
            <t>
              Unsolicited "REQUEST" methods MAY be sent by the "Organizer" of a "VTODO" calendar component. The unsolicited "REQUEST" methods are used to update the details of the "VTODO" (without rescheduling it or updating the completion status of "Attendees") or the "VTODO" calendar component itself (i.e., reconfirm the "VTODO").
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="REQUEST for Delegating a VTODO">
            <t>
              The "REQUEST" method is also used to delegate or reassign ownership of a "VTODO" calendar component to another "Calendar User". For example, it may be used to delegate an "Attendee's" role (i.e. "chair", or "participant") for a "VTODO" calendar component. The "REQUEST" method is sent by one of the "Attendees" of an existing "VTODO" calendar component to some other individual.
            </t>
            <t>
              For the purposes of this description, the "Attendee" delegating the "VTODO" calendar component is referred to as the "Delegator". The "Attendee" receiving the delegation request is referred to as the "Delegate".
            </t>
            <t>
              The "Delegator" of a "VTODO" calendar component MUST forward the existing "REQUEST" method for a "VTODO" calendar component to the "Delegate". The "VTODO" calendar component description MUST include the "Delegator's" up-to-date "VTODO" calendar component definition. The "REQUEST" method MUST also include an "ATTENDEE" property with the calendar address of the "Delegate". The "Delegator" MUST also send a "REPLY" method back to the "Organizer" with the "Delegator's" "Attendee" property "PARTSTAT" parameter value set to "DELEGATED". In addition, the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter MUST be included with the calendar address of the "Delegate". A response to the delegation "REQUEST" is sent from the "Delegate" to the "Organizer" and optionally, to the "Delegator". The "REPLY" method from the "Delegate" SHOULD include the "ATTENDEE" property with their calendar address and the "DELEGATED-FROM" parameter with the value of the "Delegator's" calendar address.
            </t>
            <t>
              The delegation "REQUEST" method MUST assign a value for the "RSVP" property parameter associated with the "Delegator's" "Attendee" property to that of the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property. For example if the "Delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property specifies "RSVP=TRUE", then the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property MUST specify "RSVP=TRUE".
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="REQUEST Forwarded To An Uninvited Calendar User">
            <t>
              An "Attendee" assigned a "VTODO" calendar component may send the "VTODO" calendar component to another new CU, not previously associated with the "VTODO" calendar component. The current "Attendee" assigned the "VTODO" calendar component does this by forwarding the original "REQUEST" method to the new CU. The new CU can send a "REPLY" to the "Organizer" of the "VTODO" calendar component. The reply contains an "ATTENDEE" property for the new CU.
            </t>
            <t>
              The "Organizer" ultimately decides whether or not the new CU becomes part of the to-do and is not obligated to do anything with a "REPLY" from a new (uninvited) CU. If the "Organizer" does not want the new CU to be part of the to-do, the new "ATTENDEE" property is not added to the "VTODO" calendar component. The "Organizer" MAY send the CU a "CANCEL" message to indicate that they will not be added to the to- do. If the "Organizer" decides to add the new CU, the new "ATTENDEE" property is added to the "VTODO" calendar component. Furthermore, the "Organizer" is free to change any "ATTENDEE" property parameter from the values supplied by the new CU to something the "Organizer" considers appropriate.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="REQUEST Updated Attendee Status">
            <t>
              An "Organizer" of a "VTODO" may request an updated status from one or more "Attendees". The "Organizer" sends a "REQUEST" method to the "Attendee" with the "ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE" property sequence. The "SEQUENCE" property for the "VTODO" is not changed from its previous value. A recipient determines that the only change in the "REQUEST" is that their "RSVP" property parameter indicates a request for an updated status. The recipient SHOULD respond with a "REPLY" method indicating their current status with respect to the "REQUEST".
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="REPLY">
          <t>
            The "REPLY" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used to respond (e.g., accept or decline) to a request or to reply to a delegation request. It is also used by an "Attendee" to update their completion status. When used to provide a delegation response, the "Delegator" MUST include the calendar address of the "Delegate" in the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter of the "Delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property. The "Delegate" MUST include the calendar address of the "Delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" parameter of the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "REPLY" method MAY also be used to respond to an unsuccessful "VTODO" calendar component "REQUEST" method. Depending on the "REQUEST-STATUS" value, no scheduling action may have been performed.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "Organizer" of a "VTODO" calendar component MAY receive a "REPLY" method from a "Calendar User" not in the original "REQUEST". For example, a "REPLY" method MAY be received from a "Delegate" of a "VTODO" calendar component. In addition, the "REPLY" method MAY be received from an unknown "Calendar User", having been forwarded the "REQUEST" by an original "Attendee" of the "VTODO" calendar component. This uninvited "Attendee" MAY be accepted, or the "Organizer" MAY cancel the "VTODO" calendar component for the uninvited "Attendee" by sending them a "CANCEL" method.

            The "ADD" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used to add one or more instances to an existing to-do.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the "UID" property value in the "ADD" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the recipient SHOULD send a "REFRESH" to the "Organizer" in order to be updated with the latest version of the "VTODO". If an "Attendee" implementation does not support the "ADD" method it should respond with a "REQUEST-STATUS" value of 3.14 and ask for a "REFRESH".
          </t>
          <t>
            The "SEQUENCE" property value is incremented as the sequence of to-dos has changed.

          <t>
            The "CANCEL" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used to send a cancellation notice of an existing "VTODO" calendar request to the affected "Attendees". The message is sent by the "Organizer" of a "VTODO" calendar component to the "Attendees" of the "VTODO" calendar component. For a recurring "VTODO" calendar component, either the whole "VTODO" calendar component or instances of a "VTODO" calendar component may be cancelled. To cancel the complete range of a recurring "VTODO" calendar component, the "UID" property value for the "VTODO" calendar component MUST be specified and a "RECURRENCE- ID" MUST NOT be specified in the "CANCEL" method. In order to cancel an individual instance of a recurring "VTODO" calendar component, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value for the "VTODO" calendar component MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are two options for canceling a sequence of instances of a recurring "VTODO" calendar component:
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="letters">
              <t>
                the "RECURRENCE-ID" property for an instance in the sequence MUST be specified with the "RANGE" property parameter value of "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate cancellation of the specified "VTODO" calendar component and all instances after
              </t>
              <t>
                individual recurrence instances may be cancelled by specifying multiple "VTODO" components with a "RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to one of the instances to be cancelled
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            When a "VTODO" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be incremented.
          </t>

            The "REFRESH" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used by "Attendees" of an existing "VTODO" calendar component to request an updated description from the "Organizer" of the "VTODO" calendar component. The "Organizer" of the "VTODO" calendar component MAY use this method to request an updated status from the "Attendees". The "REFRESH" method MUST specify the "UID" property corresponding to the "VTODO" calendar component needing update.
          </t>
          <t>
            A refresh of a recurrence instance of a "VTODO" calendar component may be requested by specifying the "RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to the associated "VTODO" calendar component. The "Organizer" responds with the latest description and rendition of the "VTODO" calendar component. In most cases this will be a REQUEST unless the "VTODO" has been cancelled, in which case the ORGANIZER MUST send a "CANCEL". This method is intended to facilitate machine processing of requests for updates to a "VTODO" calendar component.

          <t>
            The "COUNTER" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used by an "Attendee" of an existing "VTODO" calendar component to submit to the "Organizer" a counter proposal for the "VTODO" calendar component.
          </t>
          <t>
            The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a "VTODO" calendar component describing the complete description of the alternate "VTODO" calendar component.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the "Attendee" a "DECLINECOUNTER" method. The "Organizer" accepts the counter proposal by sending all of the "Attendees" of the "VTODO" calendar component a "REQUEST" method rescheduling the "VTODO" calendar component. In the latter case, the "Organizer" SHOULD reset the individual "RSVP" property parameter values to TRUE on each "ATTENDEE" property in order to force a response by the "Attendees".

            The "PUBLISH" method in a "VJOURNAL" calendar component has no associated response. It is simply a posting of an iCalendar object that may be added to a calendar. It MUST have an "Organizer". It MUST NOT have "Attendees". The expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary journal entry as an iCalendar object. The "Organizer" MAY subsequently update (with another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a previously published journal entry.
          </t>
          <t>
            This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the following property constraints:

            The "CANCEL" method in a "VJOURNAL" calendar component is used to send a cancellation notice of an existing journal entry. The message is sent by the "Organizer" of a journal entry. For a recurring journal entry, either the whole journal entry or instances of a journal entry may be cancelled. To cancel the complete range of a recurring journal entry, the "UID" property value for the journal entry MUST be specified and a "RECURRENCE-ID" property MUST NOT be specified in the "CANCEL" method. In order to cancel an individual instance of the journal entry, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value for the journal entry MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are two options for canceling a sequence of instances of a recurring "VJOURNAL" calendar component:
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="letters">
              <t>
                the "RECURRENCE-ID" property for an instance in the sequence MUST be specified with the "RANGE" property parameter value of "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate cancellation of the specified "VTODO" calendar component and all instances after
              </t>
              <t>
                individual recurrence instances may be cancelled by specifying multiple "VJOURNAL" components with a "RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to one of the instances to be cancelled
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            When a "VJOURNAL" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be incremented.
          </t>

          The "REQUEST-STATUS" property is used to convey status information about a REPLY, COUNTER or DECLINE-COUNTER iTIP message. The codes listed in the table below SHOULD be used. Additional codes MAY be used provided they are defined in a Standards Track or Experimental RFC.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification allows for multiple "REQUEST-STATUS" properties to be returned in iCalendar components in the appropriate iTIP messages. When multiple "REQUEST-STATUS" properties are present, the following restrictions apply:

        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Within any one component, the "top-level" numeric value of the "short return status code" MUST be the same for all REQUEST-STATUS properties. i.e. there cannot be a mixture of e.g., 2.xx and 5.xx codes within a single component.</t>
            <t>Across all components in the iTIP message, the following applies:
            <list style="letters">
              <t>If any one component would have a 5.xx code, then all components MUST have a code in that range or "REQUEST-STATUS" MUST NOT be present in the other components if a 5.xx code is not appropriate for those components.</t>
              <t>Otherwise, if any one component would have a 3.xx code, then all components MUST have a code in that range or "REQUEST-STATUS" MUST NOT be present in the other components if a 3.xx code is not appropriate for those components.</t>
              <t>2.xx and 4.xx codes can be used in different components provided that each component follows the restriction in (1) above.</t>

        <section title="Working With Recurrence Instances">
          <t>
            iCalendar includes a recurrence grammar to represent recurring events. The benefit of such a grammar is the ability to represent a number of events in a single object. However, while this simplifies creation of a recurring event, meeting instances still need to be referenced. For instance, an "Attendee" may decline the third instance of a recurring Friday event. Similarly, the "Organizer" may change the time or location to a single instance of the recurring event.
          </t>
          <t>
            Since implementations may elect to store recurring events as either a single event object or a collection of discrete, related event objects, the protocol is designed so that each recurring instance may be both referenced and versioned. Hence, implementations that choose to maintain per-instance properties (such as "ATTENDEE" property "PARTSTAT" parameter) may do so. However, the protocol does not require per-instance recognition unless the instance itself must be renegotiated.
          </t>
          <t>
            The scenarios for recurrence instance referencing are listed below. For purposes of simplification a change to an event refers to a "trigger property." That is, a property that has a substantive effect on the meeting itself such as start time, location, due date (for "VTODO" calendar component components) and possibly description.
          </t>
          <t>
            "Organizer" initiated actions:
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                "Organizer" deletes or changes a single instance of a recurring event
              </t>
              <t>
                "Organizer" makes changes that affect all future instances
              </t>
              <t>
                "Organizer" makes changes that affect all previous instances
              </t>
              <t>
                "Organizer" deletes or modifies a previously changed instance
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>

                "Attendee" changes status for a particular recurrence instance
              </t>
              <t>
                "Attendee" sends event-Counter for a particular recurrence instance
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            An instance of a recurring event is assigned a unique identification, "RECURRENCE-ID" property, when that instance is renegotiated. Negotiation may be necessary when a substantive change to the event or to-do has been made (such as changing the start time, end time, due date or location). The "Organizer" can identify a specific recurrence instance using the "RECURRENCE-ID" property. The property value is equal to the date/time of the instance. If the "Organizer" wishes to change the "DTSTART", the original unmodified "DTSTART" value of the instance is used as the value  "RECURRENCE-ID" property and the new "DTSTART" and "DTEND" values reflect the change.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Attendee Property Considerations">
          <t>
            The "ORGANIZER" property is required on published events, to-dos, and journal entries for two reasons. First, only the "Organizer" is allowed to update and redistribute an event or to-do component. It follows that the "ORGANIZER" property MUST be present in the event, to-do, or journal entry component so that the CUA has a basis for authorizing an update. Second, it is prudent to provide a point of contact for anyone who receives a published component in case of problems.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are valid 
            <xref target="RFC2822" />
            addresses that represent groups. Sending email to such an address results in mail being sent to multiple recipients. Such an address may be used as the value of an "ATTENDEE" property. Thus, it is possible that the recipient of a "REQUEST" does not appear explicitly in the list. 
          </t>
          <t>
            It is recommended that the general approach to finding a "Calendar User" in an attendee list be as follows:
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                Search for the "Calendar User" in the attendee list where "CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL"
              </t>
              <t>
                Failing (1) look for attendees where "CUTYPE=GROUP" or 'CUTYPE=UNKNOWN". The CUA then determines if the "Calendar User" is a member of one of these groups. If so, the "REPLY" method sent to the "Organizer" MUST contain a new "ATTENDEE" property in which:
              </t>
              <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>
                    the "TYPE" property parameter is set to INDIVIDUAL
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    the "MEMBER" property parameter is set to the name of the group
                  </t>
                </list>
              </t>
              <t>
                Failing (2) the CUA MAY ignore or accept the request as the "Calendar User" wishes.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Extension Tokens">
          <t>
            To make iCalendar objects extensible, new component, property or property parameters can be used. Two types of extension exist: IANA registered tokens and X- vendor-specific tokens. A client SHOULD save IANA tokens and MAY use them in replies. A client MAY save X- Tokens and MAY use them in replies. When delegating or forwarding messages to other CUs, a client SHOULD include IANA and X- tokens.

        <t>
          In the calendaring and scheduling context, publication refers to the one way transfer of event information. Consumers of published events simply incorporate the event into a calendar. No reply is expected. Individual "A" publishes an event. Individual "B" reads the event and incorporates it into their calendar. Events are published in several ways including: embedding the event as an object in a web page, e-mailing the event to a distribution list, or posting the event to a newsgroup.

            The "UID" property is used by the client to identify the event. The "SEQUENCE" property indicates that this is a change to the event. The event with a matching UID and sequence number 0 is superseded by this event.

            The "SEQUENCE" property provides a reliable way to distinguish different versions of the same event. Each time an event is published, its sequence number is incremented. If a client receives an event with a sequence number 5 and finds it has the same event with sequence number 2, the event SHOULD be updated. However, if the client received an event with sequence number 2 and finds it already has sequence number 5 of the same event, the event MUST NOT be updated.

            A sample meeting request is sent from "A" to "B", "C", and "D". "E" is also sent a copy of the request but is not expected to attend and need not reply. "E" illustrates how CUAs might implement an "FYI" type feature. Note the use of the "ROLE" parameter. The default value for the "ROLE" parameter is "REQ-PARTICIPANT" and it need not be enumerated. In this case we are using the value "NON-PARTICIPANT" to indicate "E" is a non-attending CU. The parameter is not needed on other "Attendees" since "PARTICIPANT" is the default value.

        <section title="Delegating an Event">
          <t>
            When delegating an event request to another "Calendar User", the "Delegator" must both update the "Organizer" with a "REPLY" and send a request to the "Delegate". There is currently no protocol limitation to delegation depth. It is possible for the original delegate to delegate the meeting to someone else, and so on. When a request is delegated from one CUA to another there are a number of responsibilities required of the "Delegator". The "Delegator" MUST: 
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                Send a "REPLY" to the "Organizer" with the following updates:
              <list style="letters">
              <t>
                The "Delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property "PARTSTAT" parameter set to "DELEGATED" and the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter is set to the address of the "Delegate"
              </t>
              <t>
                Add an additional "ATTENDEE" property for the "Delegate" with the "DELEGATED-FROM" property parameter set to the "Delegator"
              </t>
              <t>
                Indicate whether they want to continue to receive updates when the "Organizer" sends out updated versions of the event. Setting the "RSVP" property parameter to "TRUE" will cause the updates to be sent, setting it to "FALSE" causes no further updates to be sent. Note that in either case, if the "Delegate" declines the invitation the "Delegator" will be notified.
              </t>
		  	  </list>
          	  </t>
              <t>
                The "Delegator" MUST also send a copy of the original "REQUEST" method to the "Delegate", with changes (A) and (B) as detailed above applied.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            If the "Delegate" declines the meeting, the "Organizer" MUST send an update "REQUEST" to the "Delegator" so that the "Delegator" may elect to delegate the "REQUEST" to another CUA.

          <t>
            In this example the "Delegate" declines the meeting request and sets the "ATTENDEE" property "PARTSTAT" parameter to "DECLINED". The "Organizer" SHOULD resend the "REQUEST" to "C" with the "PARTSTAT" parameter of the "Delegate" set to "DECLINED". This lets the "Delegator" know that the "Delegate" has declined and provides an opportunity to the "Delegator" to either accept the request or delegate it to another CU.

          <t>
            Response from "E" to "A" and "C". Note the use of the "COMMENT" property "E" uses to indicate why the delegation was declined.

        <section title="Forwarding an Event Request">
          <t>
            The protocol does not prevent an "Attendee" from "forwarding" an "VEVENT" calendar component to other "Calendar Users". Forwarding differs from delegation in that the forwarded "Calendar User" (often referred to as a "Party Crasher") does not replace the forwarding "Calendar User". Implementations are not required to add the "Party Crasher" to the "Attendee" list and hence there is no guarantee that a "Party Crasher" will receive additional updates to the event. The forwarding "Calendar User" SHOULD NOT add the "Party Crasher" to the attendee list. The "Organizer" MAY add the forwarded "Calendar User" to the attendee list.

This is used when the meeting itself is cancelled and not when the intent is to remove an "Attendee" from the event.

        <section title="Replacing the Organizer">
          <t>
            The scenario for this example begins with "A" as the "Organizer" for a recurring meeting with "B", "C", and "D". "A" receives a new job offer in another country and drops out of touch. "A" left no forwarding address or way to be reached. Using out-of-band communication, the other "Attendees" eventually learn what has happened and reach an agreement that "B" should become the new "Organizer" for the meeting. To do this, "B" sends out a new version of the event and the other "Attendees" agree to accept "B" as the new "Organizer". "B" also removes "A" from the event.
          </t>
          <t>
            When the "Organizer" is replaced, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be incremented.
          </t>
          <t>
            This is the message "B" sends to "C" and "D"

      <section title="Busy Time Examples">
        <t>
          Busy time objects can be used in several ways. First, a CU may request busy time from another CU for a specific range of time. That request can be answered with a busy time Reply. Additionally, a CU may simply publish their busy time for a given interval and point other CUs to the published location. The following examples outline both scenarios.
        </t>
        <section title="Publish Busy Time">
        <t>

            The first component of this iCalendar object is the time zone component. The "DTSTART" date coincides with the first instance of the RRULE property.
          </t>
          <t>
            The recurring meeting is defined in a particular time zone, presumably that of the originator. The client for each "Attendee" has the responsibility of determining the recurrence time in the "Attendee's" time zone.
          </t>
          <t>
			The repeating event starts on Tuesday, July 1, 1997 at 2:00pm PDT (UTC-7). "Attendee" B@example.fr is in France where the local time on this date is 9 hours ahead of PDT or 23:00 CEST (UTC+2). "Attendee" C@example.jp is in Japan where local time is 16 hours ahead of PDT or Wednesday, July 2 at 06:00 JST (UTC+9). The event repeats weekly on Tuesdays (in PST/PDT). The "RRULE" property results in 20 instances. The last instance falls on Tuesday, November 11, 1997 2:00pm PST. The "RDATE" property adds another instance: WED, 10-SEP-1997 2:00 PM PDT.

            The scenario for this example involves an ongoing meeting, originally set up to occur every Tuesday. The "Organizer" later decides that the meetings need to be on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but does not want to reschedule the entire meeting or lose any of the per-instance information already collected.

            Assume that many other updates happen to this event and that a lot of instance-specific information exists in the recurring series. The "SEQUENCE" property value is 7 for the next update. Now the "Organizer" wants to add Thursdays to the event:

            Alternatively, if the "Organizer" is not concerned with per-instance updates, the entire event can be rescheduled using a "REQUEST". This is done by using the "UID" of the event to reschedule and including the modified "RRULE". Note, that since this is an entire rescheduling of the event, any instance-specific information will be lost.

            The next series of examples illustrate how an "Organizer" would respond to a "REFRESH" submitted by an "Attendee" after a series of instance-specific modifications. To convey all instance-specific changes, the "Organizer" must provide the latest event description and the relevant instances. The first three examples show the history including the initial "VEVENT" request and subsequent instance changes and finally the "REFRESH".

            If "B" requests a "REFRESH", "A" responds with the following to capture all instance-specific data. In this case both the initial request and an additional "VEVENT" that specifies the instance- specific data are included. Because these are both of the same type (they are both "VEVENTS"), they can be conveyed in the same iCalendar object.

        <section title="Bad RECURRENCE-ID">
          <t>
            Component instances are identified by the combination of "UID", "RECURRENCE-ID", and "SEQUENCE". When an "Organizer" sends an iTIP message to an "Attendee", there are three cases in which an instance cannot be found. They are:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                The component with the referenced "UID" and "RECURRENCE-ID" has been found but the "SEQUENCE" number in the calendar store does not match that of the ITIP message.
              </t>
              <t>
                The component with the referenced "UID" has been found, the "SEQUENCE" numbers match, but the "RECURRENCE-ID" cannot be found.
              </t>
              <t>
                The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" numbers are found but the CUA does not support recurrences.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            In case (1), two things can happen. If the "SEQUENCE" number of the "Attendee's" instance is larger than that in the "Organizer's" message then the "Attendee" is receiving an out-of-sequence message and MUST ignore it. If the "SEQUENCE" number of the "Attendee's" instance is smaller, then the "Organizer" is sending out a newer version of the component and the "Attendee's" version needs to be updated. Since one or more updates have been missed, the "Attendee" SHOULD send a "REFRESH" message to the "Organizer" to get an updated version of the event.
          </t>
          <t>
            In case (2), something has gone wrong. Both the "Organizer" and the "Attendee" should have the same instances, but the "Attendee" does not have the referenced instance. In this case the "Attendee" SHOULD send a "REFRESH" to the "Organizer" to get an updated version of the event.
          </t>
          <t>
            In case (3), the limitations of the "Attendee's" CUA makes it impossible to match an instance other than the single instance scheduled. In this case, the "Attendee" need not send a "REFRESH" to the "Organizer".
          </t>
          <t>
            The example below shows a sequence in which an "Attendee" sends a "REFRESH" to the "Organizer".

      <section title="Latency Issues">
        <t>
          With a store-and-forward transport, it is possible for events to arrive out of sequence. That is, a "CANCEL" method may be received prior to receiving the associated "REQUEST" for the calendar component. This section discusses a few of these scenarios.
        </t>
        <section title="Cancellation of an Unknown Calendar Component.">
          <t>
            When a "CANCEL" method is received before the original "REQUEST" method the calendar will be unable to correlate the "UID" property of the cancellation with an existing calendar component. It is suggested that messages that can not be correlated that also contain non-zero sequence numbers be held and not discarded. Implementations MAY age them out if no other messages arrive with the same "UID" property value and a lower sequence number.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Unexpected Reply from an Unknown Delegate">
          <t>
            When an "Attendee" delegates an item to another CU they MUST send a "REPLY" method to the "Organizer" using the "ATTENDEE" properties to indicate that the request was delegated and to whom. Hence, it is possible for an "Organizer" to receive an "REPLY" from a CU not listed as one of the original "Attendees". The resolution is left to the implementation but it is expected that the calendaring software will either accept the reply or hold it until the related "REPLY" method is received from the "Delegator". If the version of the "REPLY" method is out of date the "Organizer" SHOULD treat the message as a "REFRESH" message and update the delegate with the correct version provided that delegation to that delegate is acceptable.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Sequence Number">
        <t>
          Under some conditions, a CUA may receive requests and replies with the same "SEQUENCE" property value. The "DTSTAMP" property is utilized as a tie-breaker when two items with the same "SEQUENCE" property value are evaluated.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        ITIP is an abstract transport protocol which will be bound to a real-time transport, a store-and-forward transport, and perhaps other transports. The transport protocol will be responsible for providing facilities for authentication and encryption using standard Internet mechanisms that are mutually understood between the sender and receiver.
      </t>
      <section title="Security Threats">
        <section title="Spoofing the &quot;Organizer&quot;">
          <t>
            In iTIP, the "Organizer" (or someone working on the "Organizer's" behalf) is the only person authorized to make changes to an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar component and republish it or redistribute updates to the "Attendees". An iCalendar object that maliciously changes or cancels an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component may be constructed by someone other than the "Organizer" and republished or sent to the "Attendees".
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Spoofing the &quot;Attendee&quot;">
          <t>
            In iTIP, an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component (or someone working on the "Attendee's" behalf) is the only person authorized to update any parameter associated with their "ATTENDEE" property and send it to the "Organizer". An iCalendar object that maliciously changes the "ATTENDEE" parameters may be constructed by someone other than the real "Attendee" and sent to the "Organizer".
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Unauthorized Replacement of the Organizer">
          <t>
            There will be circumstances when "Attendees" of an event or to-do decide, using out-of-band mechanisms, that the "Organizer" must be replaced. When the new "Organizer" sends out the updated "VEVENT" or "VTODO" the "Attendee's" CUA will detect that the "Organizer" has been changed, but it has no way of knowing whether or not the change was mutually agreed upon.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Eavesdropping">
          <t>
            The iCalendar object is constructed with human-readable clear text. Any information contained in an iCalendar object may be read and/or changed by unauthorized persons while the object is in transit.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Flooding a Calendar">
          <t>
            Implementations could provide a means to automatically incorporate "REQUEST" methods into a calendar. This presents the opportunity for a calendar to be flooded with requests, which effectively block all the calendar's free time.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Unauthorized REFRESH Requests">
          <t>
            It is possible for an "Organizer" to receive a "REFRESH" request from someone who is not an "Attendee" of an event or to-do. Only "Attendee's" of an event or to-do are authorized to receive replies to "REFRESH" requests. Replying to such requests to anyone who is not an "Attendee" may be a security problem.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Recommendations">
        <t>
          For an application where the information is sensitive or critical and the network is subject to a high probability of attack, iTIP transactions SHOULD be encrypted. This may be accomplished using public key technology, specifically Security Multiparts for MIME 
          <xref target="RFC1847" />
          in the iTIP transport binding. This helps mitigate the threats of spoofing, eavesdropping and malicious changes in transit. 
        </t>
        <section title="Use of [RFC1847] to secure iTIP transactions">
          <t>
            iTIP transport bindings MUST provide a mechanism based on Security Multiparts for MIME 
            <xref target="RFC1847" />
            to enable authentication of the sender's identity, and privacy and integrity of the data being transmitted. This allows the receiver of a signed iCalendar object to verify the identity of the sender. This sender may then be correlated to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar object. If the correlation is made and the sender is authorized to make the requested change or update then the operation may proceed. It also allows the message to be encrypted to prevent unauthorized reading of the message contents in transit. iTIP transport binding documents describe this process in detail. 
          </t>
          <t>
            Implementations MAY provide controls for users to disable this capability.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Implementation Controls">
          <t>
            The threat of unauthorized replacement of the "Organizer" SHOULD be mitigated by a calendar system that uses this protocol by providing controls or alerts that make "Calendar Users" aware of such "Organizer" changes and allowing them to decide whether or not the request should be honored.
          </t>
          <t>
            The threat of flooding a calendar SHOULD be mitigated by a calendar system that uses this protocol by providing controls that may be used to limit the acceptable sources for iTIP transactions, and perhaps the size of messages and volume of traffic, by source.
          </t>
          <t>
            The threat of unauthorized "REFRESH" requests SHOULD be mitigated by a calendar system that uses this protocol by providing controls or alerts that allow "Calendar User" to decide whether or not the request should be honored. An implementation MAY decide to maintain, for audit or historical purposes, "Calendar Users" who were part of an attendee list and who were subsequently uninvited. Similar controls or alerts should be provided when a "REFRESH" request is received from these "Calendar Users" as well.
