Notes about RFC 4271

- Section 5 mentions "It is not required or expected that all BGP implementations support all optional attributes." This raises the question of what it means to "support" an attribute. If code for an attribute is present but disabled in configuration (including disabled by default, and not explicitly enabled), it counts as "not supported" for the purposes of this language, and an implementation can behave accordingly.
