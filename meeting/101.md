## Meeting Venue
The IETF 101 Meeting Venue (Hilton London Metropole) is a complicated venue, with three wings and a multitude of levels that the IETF will be using.

## Airport Transportation
[Heathrow Express](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/) - there are also ticket kiosks where you can purchase an Heathrow Express ticket before you get on the train, but the web site is cheaper..

To catch the Heathrow Express at Heathrow Airport:

For Heathrow Airport terminals 1, 2 and 3, follow the signs inside the terminal buildings for Heathrow Central train station.

For Heathrow Terminal 4, follow the signs inside the terminal building for the free shuttle bus service to Heathrow Central train station, where you can get on the Heathrow Express train. The shuttle service from Terminal 4 departs every 15 minutes and is a 4 minute journey.

For Heathrow terminal 5, follow the signs inside the building for Heathrow Terminal 5 train station.

To make the return journey to Heathrow Airport from Paddington Station:

At London Paddington, the Heathrow Express usually departs from platforms 6 and 7, but check the electronic boards inside the station for the latest information.

Please NOTE: Departing from London Paddington, the first train is at 5.10am and the last train is at 11.25pm.

Departing from Heathrow Terminal 5, the first train is at 5.07am and the last train is at 11.42pm.

Departing from Heathrow Central, the first train is at 5.12am Monday to Saturday and 5.08am on Sundays. The last train is at 11.48pm.

For Heathrow Terminal 4, the first shuttle to Heathrow Central train station is at 5.23am Monday to Saturday and 5.53am on Sundays.

Main alternative is to take the Underground (= metro). This much cheaper (~£5 vs ~£25 single) and much slower (~50 minutes vs ~15 minutes to Paddington).

For nearly all public transport in London (including bus, metro and most trains), you can either use your contactless credit or debit card, or else use an Oyster card - but unfortunately not on the Heathrow Express.

Oyster Card https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/what-is-oyster. If you have a contactless credit or debit card with a logo of concentric arcs, in most cases you can use that instead of Oyster and pay the same.

## Side Meetings
The IESG is continuing the side meeting experiment in London. For IETF 101, two rooms are available for first-come first-served signup online. The larger of the two (Hilton Meeting Rooms 1-4) will hold approximately 40 people and will be configured with a U-shaped table. The smaller room (Waterloo) will be configured as a boardroom and will hold approximately 12 people. Both rooms will have projectors.

Please note that all meetings in these rooms are subject to the IETF Meeting Room Policy.

## Public Transportation and Area Maps
NOTE: It is suggested that to get around London via public transportation, that having an Oyster Card is recommended. Oyster is a plastic smartcard you can use instead of paper tickets. You can put Travelcards, Bus & Tram season tickets and pay as you go credit on it. If you have a contactless credit or debit card, you can use that and do not need to buy an Oyster card. An Oyster Visitor card has an attractive design but is functionally the same as an ordinary card. The ordinary card is for sale at all Underground stations and many other places.

The Transport for London Oyster App (https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/ways-to-pay/tfl-oyster-app) is NOT an NFC payment app and not a substitute for a physical Oyster card.

Oyster or contactless is the cheapest way to pay for single journeys on bus, Tube, tram, and DLR services in London.

Please NOTE: All travelers are required to have their own card - although the Web site states all children under 11 travel free accompanied by an adult using a valid Visitor Oyster card or ticket. A maximum of four children under 11 can travel free with an adult who has a valid Oyster card or ticket on Tube, DLR and London Overground services.

If you’re using an Oyster card, you must touch in and touch out as normal but ask a member of staff to let your group through the side gate.

For metro, touch in and touch out (if you fail to touch out, you'll be charge assuming you travelled to the outermost zone). On the bus, touch in only.
