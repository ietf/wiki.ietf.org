2. Select "**New Account**" from the User menu at the top
3. Enter the email address that you registered with for the Hackathon
4. Follow the instructions in the email you receive

## Meeting Materials

* Code can be accessed from  [IETF Hackathon GitHub](https://github.com/ietf-hackathon), or from links provided within project descriptions below.
    * Request to be added to IETF GitHub organization by sending your GitHub ID to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org).
* Results of Hackathon projects should be uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf117-project-presentations). See the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf117-project-presentations/blob/main/README.md) for details.

## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of  [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule)
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org is used for Hackathon presentations and contains repositories for some Hackathon projects.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
    * IETF Hackathon teams should upload their Hackathon project presentations to [GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf117-project-presentations)
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, see details in the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf117-project-presentations/blob/main/README.md)
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before Hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}
  
## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#streams/326/hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for those who are new to the IETF or new to the Hackathon. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. *. *If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a * at the end of your project name.*

### QUIC in Space
- **Champion(s)**
  - Marc Blanchet (marc.blanchet at viagenie.ca)
  - Christian Huitema (huitema at huitema.net)
- **Project Info**
  - (Deep) Space comm has loooong delays (minutes to hours) and disruptions. Purpose of the project
  is to modify open-source QUIC stacks to be usable for this use case. QUIC stacks typically
  have low initial values to prime the initial communications, which does not fit with long delays
  and make various assumptions not optinal for space comm. Goal of this project is to: 
  a) externalize these static values so they could be changed at start or while running, 
  b) set a testbed to test with long delays and verify use
  c) modify stacks to support the space use case (specially for disruptions), d) if relevant, 
  write internet-draft for findings and possible modifications/extensions to QUIC.
  An initial POC was done with Christian Huitema (see below) with his picoquic stack. 
  We would like to go further with more QUIC stacks such as Mozilla Neqo (in Rust) or 
  Google Quiche(in C++) or Cloudflare Quiche (in Rust) or picoquic(in C) or QUINN (in Rust).

For example, a WAF profider may want to allow the a threat intelligence provider to be able to add new rules to the firewall on an occuring basis. If an organization may have more than one firewall, the vendor will be able to push a new rule to multiple instances using a single protocol. This protocol aims to be HTTP based as communication is across the web.
