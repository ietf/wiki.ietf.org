## Meeting Venue
Swissotel “The Stamford” Singapore and Fairmont Singapore are both part of the Raffles City Complex. The closest Mass Rapid Transit (subway) station is City Hall Station (under the Raffles City Complex).

The closest airport to the Raffles City Complex is Singapore Changi International Airport (SIN).

Raffles City Complex is strategically located in the heart of the city's business, historical, cultural and shopping districts, just 20 minutes away from Singapore Changi International Airport.

## Airport Transportation
The IETF 106 Meeting Venue, Raffles City Convention Center, is part of the Raffles City Complex.

**By Subway:**

The train station is accessible by foot from Terminal 2 or Terminal 3. Board the MRT (subway) at Changi Airport (CG2). Transfer to a west bound train at Tanah Merah Interchange station (terminus point “Tuas Link”), and alight at City Hall (NS25 / EW13). There is an exit from the station directly into the Raffles City complex where the two conference hotels are.

Buy an EZLInk stored-value fare card at the MRT ticket booth. Fares vary by distance; from the airport to City Hall is S$1.75. You can use the same card for bus and trips in Singapore, and can refund the remaining value at the Changi MRT station when you depart.

These rooms are available on a first-come first-served basis. Projectors are provided in these rooms but MeetEcho support is not. Attendee sign-up rooms are available for participants in working groups, BOFs, design teams, and other community groups to further the work of the IETF, IRTF, or IAB.

## Miscellaneous Information
It seems that Singapore is running a beta test of electronic arrival cards: https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/front/main.action.

Singapore is prone to mosquito borne diseases. The city is usually safe, but rural, forested and wet areas are a potential risk. Tropical strength (DEET) insect repellant may be recommended. Singapore is not a high malaria risk, but its not impossible given that travellers from S.E. Asia come into the country. http://www.nea.gov.sg/public-health/dengue/dengue-cases and https://www.gov.sg/microsites/zika

There are wild otters living in the river close to the venue. http://blog.nus.edu.sg/sgotters/about/ and https://mothership.sg/2017/04/marina-otters-move-to-singapore-river-after-losing-their-original-home-to-rival-bishan-family/ (map of specific family river regions)

The orchid collection at the botanical gardens is worth a visit. https://www.sbg.org.sg/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=34&Itemid=58

[Tipping in Singapore](http://www.whototip.net/tipping-in-singapore):

- Don't tip within a hotel (except for the bellhop - S$1-$2 per bag is normal).
- In restaurants - Despite the no-tipping rule, locals tell us that a small tip is greatly appreciated when someone has gone out of their way to help you, even if it's just the change, or rounding up a bit.
- Don't tip in spas.
- Don't tip your tour guide.
- Don't tip your taxi driver. You can "round up" the fare for convenience, and it will not be refused, but it is not necessary.
- Do not tip at Changi Airport - service staff can not accept a tip.

**Social Etiquette:**

- When meeting someone, shake hands firmly.
- Public affection and showing anger in public are frowned upon.
- Do not touch someone’s head, as it is considered sacred.
- Do not point or nudge.
- Feet are considered dirty. Do not point with them or use them to hold open doors.
