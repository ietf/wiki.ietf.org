# Side Meetings at IETF 121

IETF participants often organize side meetings around [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings) to discuss topics of interest to some portion of the IETF community. The IETF supports [Public Side Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/side-meetings/) by setting aside rooms that can be booked by participants and by providing basic A/V support and a WebEx meeting room for remote participants. That said, **side meetings are not part of the official IETF meeting agenda, are not approved or even reviewed by the IESG, and have no formal standing. Side meetings should not be used to imply endorsement by the IETF.**

Rooms made available for side meetings - and this wiki page - are not to be used for closed [Private Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/side-meetings/).

This wiki page is used to book the side meeting rooms and share details of the topics, contact persons, dates and times, and other information. This page provides details for side meetings around  [IETF 121 Dublin](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/121/).

# Guidelines for public side meetings

* **All public side meetings are subject to the [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well)**; participants are expected to follow the usual IETF policies on personal conduct, IPR disclosure obligations, etc.

* Public side meetings posted here are **open for any registered IETF participant** to attend. **Remote side meeting attendees must also be registered for the meeting.**

* **All** working group business needs to occur during scheduled working group sessions in ways that comply with [RFC 2026](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2026.html)  and [RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html). Working group business **must not** happen during side meetings.

  * Side meetings *may* be used for design teams or other informal discussions related to working groups.

* Side meetings **do not record formal attendance** ("blue sheets"). The organizers of side meetings may ask for participants' contact information; participants are free to withhold it.

* Organizers must seek participants' **active consent for any side meeting that is desired to be recorded**.

* Please **provide a calendar invitation** (an `.ics` file) for a side meeting by putting the link in the appropriate column below. **Please don't skip this!** Participants are surprisingly poor at correctly transcribing information from this wiki into their calendars, causing them to miss your side meeting.

## IETF 121 special considerations



* Side meeting dates and times should be listed in Dublin local time, UTC. For help converting time zones, please use a tool like [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html). Please note that Ireland will end Daylight Savings hours in October.

> During the week of October 28, some breakfast and lunch slots will be unblocked if those rooms are not needed for other meetings.
{.is-info}


# Audio/visual provision for remote participation
The small side room will be equipped with a [Meeting Owl](https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3) 360-degree camera with microphone and speaker to facilitate remote participation.

The large side room will have microphones and speakers.

The IETF provides a Chromebook with a preconfigured WebEx room in each side meeting room. The Chromebook is also configured to work with Zoom and Microsoft Teams; however you must login with your own account details to use anything other than WebEx.  

The Webex info is as follows:

* **[Wicklow Hall 2A (40 seats, U-shape)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/floor-plan?room=wicklow-hall-2a)**:
https://ietf.webex.com/meet/ietfsidemeeting2. 
[Side Meeting 2 Room specific instructions](/large_side_meeting_room_-_chromebook_instructions.pdf)

* **[Wicklow Meeting Room 4 (20 seats, conference)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/floor-plan?room=wicklow-mr-4)**: https://ietf.webex.com/meet/sidemeetingietf1. 
[Side Meeting 1 Room specific instructions](/small_side_meeting_room_-_chromebook_instructions-2.pdf)

Other platforms including Zoom, Teams, etc. can also be used.


# Two-step process for scheduling

1. **Enter your meeting information** (time, room, meeting name, related IETF area, organizer contact, description, conferening link, calendar invite) into the [meeting information table](#meetinginfo) below. **Note this is not the room reservation. The actual room reservation is in step 2.**

2. **Choose the day and time** that best accommodates your group and complete the room reservation by entering the meeting name in the tables further down. This is the actual room reservation. **If the meeting is not in the room tables, the room is not reserved!**

Also, and this should be obvious, **please don't edit others' side meeting information** without their consent.  And please leave the markdown properly formatted (i.e., check the preview before saving); if you leave the page in a messy state, **you will lose your side meeting**.

## Step 1: Meeting information {#meetinginfo}

**Note this is not the room reservation. The actual room reservation happens in the tables in Step 2 below!**
 
Please keep the tables sorted by meeting, by time.

## Step 2: Room Reservation

**Please put the name of your meeting into the tables below to reserve a room for your time slot.**

"NOT AVAILABLE" in the tables below really means that a room is **not available** during those times. Removing these labels does *not* magically make a room available, so don't do that.
