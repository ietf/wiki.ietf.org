## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](/meeting/123/hackathon/hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

- **Champion**
Stuart Cheshire &lt;cheshire@apple.com&gt;

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a self-configuring mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a [brief presentation about Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s) at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/proceedings#:~:text=iabopen). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/). This Hackathon event is open to all ‚Äî Thread Group membership is *not* required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate.

- **Participants and Project Info**

### CODECO - Benchmarking with network-compute metrics and energy-awareness across Edge-Cloud

- **Challenge 1: Green network observability and reporting**
This challenge explores energy-awareness observability and reporting that may suit telco-cloud resource management. The challenge relies on approaches and code under development in the context of the Horizon Europe project [CODECO](https://he-codeco.eu/), and also relates with a new informational draft being proposed to [IETF GREEN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-palmero-getting-ready-for-energy-efficient-networking-green/).  
The main goal of this challenge is to consider enhancements to CODECO (as a relevant example of an edge-cloud orchestrator that provides a data-compute-network approach) in terms of monitoring and exporting metrics aligned with GREEN principles e.g., CO2 network footprinting, green workload percentage. 
The reporting will be provided to Prometheus and eventually to SDN; alignment to YANG will be considered.

- **Challenge 2: Joint exposure of compute and network metrics for path selection**
	This enhancement to the CODECO framework introduces CATS-aligned path selection capabilities by leveraging [CODECO](https://he-codeco.eu/)‚Äôs existing compute and network observability. The goal is to support computing-aware traffic steering across the Edge-Cloud continuum, in line with the architectural direction of IETF CATS. 
  CODECO collects real-time infrastructure metrics -such as CPU , memory usage, latency, and network congestion‚Äî from its ACM and NetMA components and aggregates them via the PDLC-CA module into node and cluster scores. These scores are then used to inform microservice placement and potential workload redirection decisions, consistent with CATS principles. 
  The aim is to adapt the current approach to provide scores from PDLC and PDLC-CA to NetMA which may assist in Path ranking and selection based on dynamic network latency and congestion data. 
  This design supports the CATS use case of service instance selection and path steering based on combined compute and network metrics, helping optimize service experience in distributed, heterogeneous edge environments.

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk
  - Rodney Grimes rgrimes@freebsd.org
  - Alistair Woodman awoodman@netdef.org

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on realising ILNP on IPv6.

### Mari: scalable multi-gateway TSCH networking for Robot Swarms

- **Champions**:
  Geovane Fedrecheski, geovane.fedrecheski@inria.fr

- **Project Info**

Mari (Micro-robot Access Radio Infrastructure) is a lightweight, [open-source](https://github.com/DotBots/mari) protocol stack that brings multi-gateway Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radios, with support for node-initiated roaming. Mari is a completely new link layer that replaces the BLE controller and host software. Built to support large-scale robot swarms and dense IoT deployments, Mari enables fast handovers, predictable latency, and efficient over-the-air updates.

BLE alone does not scale beyond 5‚Äì20 concurrent connections (depending on the stack), Wi-Fi supports more nodes but suffers from collisions and higher power draw, and 6TiSCH offers deterministic communication but lacks support for node mobility.

Mari fills this gap by:
- Implementing TSCH directly over the BLE PHY (bypassing the BLE controller and host stack)
- Supporting seamless roaming across multiple gateways without requiring coordination
- Running on widely available hardware (e.g., nRF52840, nRF5340)
- Enabling near real time control and dense deployments (100+ nodes)

While Thread and BLE Mesh are designed for static home automation using IPv6 over 6LoWPAN or flooding protocols, Mari targets mobile and high-density scenarios -- such as [robot swarms](https://hal.science/hal-04673787v1/file/Demo__DotBot__a_cm_Scale__Easy_to_Use_Micro_Robot_for_Swarm_Research__Said_Owned_.pdf) -- where real-time communication, bounded latency, and remote firmware updates are crucial.

At the IETF 123 Hackathon, we aim to:
- Demonstrate a live Mari deployment with 40 nodes connected to a single gateway
- Explore how Mari (as a link-layer protocol) can interoperate with upper-layer IETF technologies, including 6LoWPAN, UDP, and CoAP
- Specify/implement a secure association for Mari using IETF technologies such as EDHOC and ELA

We welcome collaboration with anyone working on:
- Low-power networking and Internet of Things protocols
- CoAP over BLE or lightweight embedded stacks
- Mobility extensions to 6TiSCH or RPL
- Robotics, swarm testbeds, or dense IoT deployments

- **Project Info**
Test interoperability of Post Quantum algorithms in x.509 structures (Certificates, keys, CMS and other drafts).   This project started in November 2022 and continues to evolve.  We currently have some github automated actions to automaticlaly test submitted artifacts allowing implementations to get immedidate feedback on their compatibility. This allows us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

At IETF 123, we plan to add more automation, add interoperability testing for the private key formats (like ML-DSA and ML-KEM), and continue to update our implementations to support the FIPS 203, 204 and 205 algorithm standards.  We are also looking for implementations of Composite Signatures, Composite KEM and other PQ transition mechanisms that are being standardized.    

There is also interest in setup and testing the use of hybrid certificates for the TLSv1.3 protocol. The goal of the experiment is to explore different options for efficient use of hybrid certificates' and their multiple signature keys in the TLS protocol.

Validate GREEN Framework to cover different use cases listed in the GREEN use cases draft:
* device/component energy consumption report with information collected directly from the device or PDU connected.
* API integration to cover multi/inter domain.
* End-to-End use case, video streaming.

This use case aims to provide energy information at the service level to both users and providers, addressing the rebound effects seen in traditional energy efficiency approaches. By raising user awareness of ecological impacts and integrating incentivization methods, such as carbon market access, the goal is to internalize ecological effects for users. The demonstration platform will showcase energy information exposure through the collection, aggregation, and attribution of energy data across various network components, including wireless, transport, and data center equipment. Metrics will be expressed using standard data models like YANG to facilitate cross-domain energy information exchange. The platform will be validated with a video streaming example, while open questions remain about the best reporting interfaces and protocols, either as in-session reports or domain-specific exposure APIs.

The setup will consist on remote infrastrcuture in Telef√≥nica Network and Automation lab, remote wireless access infrastructure in Internet Institute (ININ) lab, plus on-site devices.

Part of the hackathon work is framed on the activities being carried out by the Exigence Project (https://projectexigence.eu), funded by the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) under the European Union's Horizon Europe programme (Grant Agreement no. 101139120).

- **Champions**
David Plonka dave@plonka.us (MAPRG co-chair, WiscNet's Principal Research Scientist)

- **Project Info**
The Measurement & Analysis for Protocols Research Group ([MAPRG](https://www.irtf.org/maprg.html)) and [WiscNet (AS2381)](https://wiscnet.net/) will provide an open testing environment for participants to determine how well equipment and applications work, including Happy Eyeballs, in a variety of IPv6 network environments.

  To accomplish this, we will provide access to the IPv6 Test Pod (https://ipv6-pod.info/): a wireless and wired access point specially configured for testing IPv6 compatibility and graciously provided by [Internet2](https://internet2.edu/) and the [ARIN Community Grant program](https://www.arin.net/blog/2023/09/11/Congratulations-2023-ARIN-Community-GrantRecipients/#ipv6-test-pod).

  > The IPv6 Test Pod provides a variety of IPv6 test networks via Wifi SSIDs and optionally over Wired Ethernet connections. All you have to do is provide a wired internet connection to the WAN interface (IPv4-only is OK), power, and it will provide a series of networks to test devices and software with:
  >
  > * Dual-Stack (IPv4 and IPv6)
  > * IPv6-only
  > * IPv6 only with NAT64+DNS64
  > * IPv6-only with NAT64+PREF64
  > * IPv6 only with NAT64+DNS64+PREF64

  In addition to employing the IPv6 Test Pod, we'll do complementary testing with IPvFoo browser extension, the IETF network, etc.

- **Open Call for Participants**
  *Anyone* can drop by for ad hoc IPv6-compatibility testing of your wireless or wired user equipment, *e.g.,* smartphone, or application(s) of interest, web-based or otherwise.

  Please join the project, and stay a while, if you are an IPv6 or transition mechanism aficionado, or simply want to learn more about using IPv6 in a live environment. We could use help with testing and identifying the root causes of problems found.

- **Project Info**

In the current network deployments, communicating entities implicitly rely on peer entities and use paths as determined by the control plane.  These available path(s) are implicitly trusted. Communicating entities have very little information about the entities in the paths over which their traffic is carried, and have no available means to audit the entities and paths, beyond basic properties like latency, throughput, and congestion.  However, increased demand in network security, privacy, and robustness makes tools for enabling visibility of the entities' security characteristics a necessity.

The Network Attestation for Secured foRwarding (NASR) aims to address the challenges associated with proving state and characteristics of a network path are compliant to a set of claims, so as to achieve predictable and verifiable forwarding behavior.

Our team brings together the [PREDICT-6G](https://predict-6g.eu), [DESIRE6G](https://desire6g.eu) and [6G-DATADRIVEN-04](https://unica6g.it.uc3m.es/en/6g-datadriven/) projects to tackle Deterministic Networking (DetNet) at IETF 123 Hackathon in Madrid. 

- **Challenge 1: Controller plane API and intelligence**
Building on PREDICT-6G‚Äôs open-source DetNet-based dataplane‚Äîan XDP/eBPF implementation that already supports PREOF (Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions) and runs DetNet over MPLS-in-UDP/IP. Currently, its DetNet functionality is statically configured at boot time via JSON configuration files and lacks a standardized way to interact with the dataplane dynamically.
To overcome these limitations, we will design and implement a lightweight control and configuration API‚Äîexposed via REST/gRPC‚Äîthat interfaces directly with the dataplane. This API will allow operators‚Äîand higher-level controllers‚Äîto define node behavior on the fly: pushing new service definitions, querying per-node state, updating PREOF replication and elimination settings, or modifying a node‚Äôs MPLS role (push, pop, forward), all without restarting or reloading static files.
On top of this, we will integrate a decision-making engine powered by a compact AI module. Given a service profile (with data such as bandwidth, latency bound, extra TSN needs such as PREOF-style reliability, etc.) and a network topology model, this engine will compute suitable DetNet paths‚Äîincluding disjoint and multi-path options‚Äîand automatically invoke the API to configure each hop. As services originate, change, or terminate, the system will coordinate per-flow S-Label usage, adjust resource reservations, and adapt routes‚Äîreconfiguring nodes seamlessly and meeting stringent DetNet guarantees end-to-end.

- **Challenge 2: In-band Telemetry (INT) for DetNet**
5G and emerging 6G systems must make increasingly faster and more reliable decisions at the network edge. In industrial environments, determinism is one of the most critical connectivity requirements‚Äîthe ability to deliver information at a precise moment in time (in-time) or within a strict delay bound (on-time). Deterministic communication not only constrains delivery latency, but also minimizes delay variation (jitter). In parallel, network reliability becomes essential to ensure uninterrupted service, particularly for mission-critical applications. Today, one of the leading proposals to support deterministic behavior at Layer 3 is defined by the IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) Working Group.
At DESIRE-6G, we‚Äôve built a DetNet-based transport network that integrates Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) to enhance reliability while connecting a fully deterministic environment like PREDICT-6G with the DESIRE-6G domain. This implementation is designed for the precise delivery of information, but how can we measure whether the network is performing as expected? One promising approach is to apply In-band Network Telemetry (INT), a technique that enables real-time data plane monitoring by embedding telemetry information within packets.
At Telef√≥nica, we‚Äôve been experimenting with this technology, and now we invite you to take part in the challenge:
Can you design a Wireshark dissector for INT headers to help advance the state of deterministic networking and contribute to the open-source community?

### Improving RPKI Repository Efficiency and Practices
- **Champions**
  - Taiji Kimura (taiji-k@nic.ad.jp)
  - Wataru Ohgai (alt@nic.ad.jp)
- **Project Info**
This project focuses on improving the efficiency and operational understanding of RPKI repositories, particularly in the context of RRDP (RPKI Repository Delta Protocol) object delivery.<br>
First, we will analyze access logs from RRDP servers to determine the actual download patterns of clients‚Äîhow often they download `snapshot.xml` versus `delta.xml`. This analysis will help us assess the optimal number of delta files to retain in the repository in order to avoid unnecessary snapshot downloads, leading to more efficient bandwidth use and client synchronization.
Second, we will conduct a comparative study of RPKI repositories operated by other organizations. This includes inspecting the number of deltas and snapshots retained, repository structure, and consistency of RRDP behavior. The goal is to identify common practices and variations across implementations, which will inform operational recommendations.<br>
Together, these efforts aim to support better-informed design and operation of RRDP-based RPKI repositories by offering both empirical data and tooling.

- **Project Info**
  Traditional network protocol testing methods face significant challenges in adapting to rapid protocol evolution. The challenges stem primarily from protocol specification analysis and customized code development for testing. To address this, we propose NeTestLLM, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework that automates protocol testing through two key components: (1) a hybrid test case generator that extracts protocol specifications and produces high-coverage test cases, and (2) a retrieval-feedback-enhanced engine that translates natural language descriptions into executable code.

- **Hackathon Plan**
  - Apply LLM to RFC protocol comprehension, including functional modeling, field analysis, and state machine extraction.
  - Leverage LLM to automatically transform protocol comprehension results into multiple test cases.
  - Convert predefined test cases into executable test code and execute verification in real-world environments.

- **Champions**
Ferenc Fejes (ferenc.fejes@ericsson.com)

- **Project Info**
tablesnoop is a real-time observability tool for Linux kernel table lookups. Using eBPF probes, it taps into the forwarding information base (FIB) for lookups and provides details about them. For example, it provides the source and destination addresses and the next-hop if the lookup was successful. At the moment, only IPv4 and IPv6 routing and rule lookups supported.

- **Hackathon Tasks**
1. Extend the tool with SRv6 network programming tracing (e.g.: End behaviors, cSID visualization)
2. Improve compatibility with older Linux kernel versions, distros
3. GitHub CI to build and publish static binary executable

### Multipath TCP support in Linux apps
- **Champions**
  Matthieu Baerts (matttbe@kernel.org)

- **Project Info**
  Multipath TCP or MPTCP is an extension to the standard TCP and is described in RFC 8684. It allows a device to make use of multiple interfaces at once to send and receive TCP packets over a single MPTCP connection. MPTCP can aggregate the bandwidth of multiple interfaces or prefer the one with the lowest latency. It also allows a fail-over if one path is down, and the traffic is seamlessly reinjected on other paths.

  Now that MPTCP is included in the Linux kernel, it is extremely easy to use it. Applications can support it natively (a "one line" modification), or can be forced. Some applications, mainly on the server side, even support it by default.

  Fore more details, see the [mptcp.dev](https://www.mptcp.dev) website.

- **Specifications**
  - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8684
  
- **Hackathon Plan**
  Add native MPTCP support in more apps. On Linux, adding native MPTCP support should be limited to the modification of the `socket` syscall. More details [here](https://www.mptcp.dev/implementation.html).
  Some applications already support MPTCP natively, see some [examples](https://www.mptcp.dev/apps.html). For some ideas, feel free to look at this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F2-v4Dhdn0rMyJZ3m5chyNiwg7oj0rpSR11GEykatJw/edit?gid=0#gid=0): Firefox, OpenSSH, Syncthing, OpenVPN, IPerf2, etc.
  Other ideas:
  - Add native support in some languages core net libraries, e.g. Python, Rust, etc.
  - Improve some components, e.g. Path-Manager (better support the MP_CAPABLE C-flag), Packet Scheduler, socket options, etc.

### Benchmarking EverCBOR and EverCDDL, formally verified parsers and serializers for CBOR and CDDL
- **Champions**
Tahina Ramananandro (taramana@microsoft.com)
- **Project Info**
With my colleagues Nik Swamy, Guido Martinez and Gabriel Ebner at Microsoft Research [RiSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/), we have recently been studying the [CBOR](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949) and [CDDL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8610.html) specifications and have produced a formal model of them, backed by formally verified executable code.
We present *EverCBOR*, a formally verified C and Rust implementations of CBOR, as well as *EverCDDL*, a formally verified parser and serializer generator from CDDL data descriptions, all proven correct for memory safety, arithmetic safety, functional correctness, non-ambiguity, and (for the deterministic subset of CBOR) non-malleability. We have used EverCDDL to produce a formally verified C and Rust implementation of COSE signing.  The runtime performance of our implementation is in the ballpark of existing unverified implementations such as qcbor and tinycbor; we validate Deterministic CBOR in constant stack space.
The [code and proofs](https://github.com/project-everest/everparse) are open-source and available on GitHub, along with a [pre-built Docker image](https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/pkgs/container/evercbor). Further details in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17335) that we posted on arXiv, and that has just been accepted to [ACM CCS 2025](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/).
- **Goals**
Performance benchmarking of EverCBOR
Applicability of EverCDDL to protocols using CBOR (and maybe CDDL). Examples may include but are not limited to: COSE, CWT, SCITT, IoTOPS, OSCORE, ACE, SDF,...
Performance benchmarking of parsers and serializers generated by EverCDDL

### RATS Endorsement Distribution to Verifiers with CoSERV
- **Champions**
Paul Howard (paul.howard@arm.com)
Thomas Fossati (thomas.fossati@linaro.org)
- **Project Info**
Endorsements and Reference Values, defined in [RFC9334](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9334.html), are essential artifacts for attestation evidence appraisal. They can originate from various sources throughout the supply chain, including silicon manufacturers, hardware integrators, firmware providers, and software providers. Their distribution is influenced by technical, commercial, and even geopolitical factors. The potential consumers of these artifacts, referred to as ‚ÄúVerifiers‚Äù in RATS terms, include cloud-hosted verification services, local verifiers bundled with relying parties, constrained nodes, and endpoint devices. This acute diversity creates challenges for software integration and poses fragmentation risks. Aligning on data formats and APIs will help address these challenges and maximise software component reuse for data transactions between endpoints.
This hackathon project will use components from the open-source [Veraison](https://github.com/veraison) project to demonstrate the use of CoSERV as the basis for a common endorsement distribution mechanism.

- **Project Info**
ASPA (Autonomous System Provider Authorization) is a protocol proposed in the [sidrops working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sidrops/about/) that enables routers to detect route leaks inside the AS_PATH of incoming BGP announcements. The RTR protocol allows to deliver ASPA data records, which are needed for verification, from a trusted relying party to a router.
The [RTRlib](https://github.com/rtrlib/rtrlib) is a C library that impelements both protocols.

- **Hackathon Plan**
We want to update the ASPA and RTRv2 implementation provided by the RTRlib to conform with current versions of the drafts. We also plan to perform inter-operatbility tests of the RTRlib with different RPKI cache servers such as [Routinator](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator).

### Multipath Traffic Engineering (MPTE)

- **Champions**

    - Kireeti Kompella (kireeti.ietf@gmail.com)
    - Vishnu Pavan Beeram (vbeeram@juniper.net)

- **Project Info**
Multipath Traffic Engineering (MPTE) is a traffic engineering (TE) paradigm that combines TE with Equal/Unequal-Cost Multipath (ECMP/UCMP) load-balancing. The notions of MPTE and of an MPTE Directed Acyclic Graph (MPTED) tunnel are introduced in [draft-kompella-teas-mpte].  An MPTED tunnel is a Traffic Engineering (TE) construct that contains a constrained set of paths representing an optimized Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from one or more ingresses to one or more egresses.  The paths that make up an MPTED tunnel traverse a set of junction nodes, and the state associated with the MPTED at each junction node constitutes a set of previous-hops and a set of next-hops over which traffic is load-balanced in a weighted fashion.  Provisioning an MPTED tunnel in a TE network using a signaling protocol involves provisioning control and forwarding plane state at each junction node. An MPTED tunnel may be realized over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) forwarding plane or a native Internet Protocol (IP) v4/v6 forwarding plane using an appropriate tunnel type.  Depending on the deployment needs, a centralized or a distributed approach MAY be adopted for provisioning an MPTED tunnel.

	- Hackathon Goals:
    	- Evaluate the unique characteristics of MPTED tunnels (multiple ingresses, multiple egresses, largely pinned DAG shape, handling resource failures and congestion events)
    	- Evaluate the requirements of the signaling protocol.
    	- Evaluate RSVP signaling procedures and sequences in detail.
    	- Evaluate PCEP signaling procedures.
    	- Evaluate MPTED data model for managing MPTED tunnels and junctions (config/state).
    	- Evaluate different tunnel types (traditional/shared MPLS forwarding plane, Native v4/v6)

### KEM-based Authentication for EDHOC

- **Champions**
Lidia Pocero Fraile (pocero@isi.gr)
Apostolos Fournaris (fournaris@isi.gr)
Evangelos Haleplidis (haleplidis@isi.gr)

- **Project Info**
We will begin implementing the new Internet-Draft proposal for KEM-based authentication in EDHOC. This proposal introduces a signature-free, post-quantum secure method for authenticated key exchange using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) KEMs. 

Our implementation will extend the KEM-based authentication method on top of the PQ-EDHOC repository, which itself builds upon the uOSCORE-uEDHOC library to support PQC signature-based EDHOC. The C implementation targets both Linux-based high-end systems (x86 and 64-bit ARM architectures) and constrained devices based on Cortex-M4, running over the Zephyr RTOS. We aim to demonstrate end-to-end secure session establishment through EDHOC without relying on digital signatures, leveraging modern post-quantum KEMs.

### Rust-based Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW) implementation
- **Champions**
Ionu»õ Mihalcea (ionut.mihalcea@arm.com)
- **Project Info**
CMW is a new data type designed in the RATS WG as an abstraction layer for remote attestation conceptual messages. This new format is meant to be used both as a way to easily integrate remote attestation with other network protocols, and as a way to model complex, layered attesters and composite devices.
The Hackathon work will focus on creating a Rust-native library for creating, parsing, and handling CMWs. The goal is to prove interoperability (with the existing Go library), and to validate the design.

### Applying YANG Provenance Signatures

- **Champions**
Diego L√≥pez, diego.r.lopez@telefonica.com
Ana M√©ndez, ana.mendezperez@telefonica.com

- **Project Info**
At the IETF 122 Hackathon we introduced and demonstrated a YANG provenance signature framework, based on the referece specification and implemented as microservices, useful to sign and verify YANG data elements in support of the assurance of their origin and integrity.
We continue working on the YANG provenance framework, attempting to demonstrate its integration with a Kafka bus, and its convergence with current approaches to address YANG data integration in state-of-the-art data infrastructures.

### AS Relationship Based Inter-domain Filtering (ARBIF)

- **Champions**
Gang Ren (rengang@cernet.edu.cn)
Shuqi Liu (liu-sq23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)

- **Project Info**
Inter-domain Source Address Validation (SAV) is important in relieving IP spoofing. It is a distributed inter-domain SAV scheme based on AS relationships we proposed in the SAVNET Working Group, named AS Relationship Based Inter-domain Filtering (ARBIF).

- **Hackathon Plan**
	- Discuss the design and implementation of the ARBIF
	- Implement and test methods of getting AS relationships and getting IP prefixes corresponding to ASes in the ARBIF
	- Gain more hands-on experience and insights into the implementation and operation of ARBIF
