## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](/meeting/123/hackathon/hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

### CODECO - Benchmarking with network-compute metrics and energy-awareness across Edge-Cloud

- **Challenge 1: Green network observability and reporting**
This challenge explores energy-awareness observability and reporting that may suit telco-cloud resource management. The challenge relies on approaches and code under development in the context of the Horizon Europe project [CODECO](https://he-codeco.eu/), and also relates with a new informational draft being proposed to [IETF GREEN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-palmero-getting-ready-for-energy-efficient-networking-green/).  
The main goal of this challenge is to consider enhancements to CODECO (as a relevant example of an edge-cloud orchestrator that provides a data-compute-network approach) in terms of monitoring and exporting metrics aligned with GREEN principles e.g., CO2 network footprinting, green workload percentage. 
The reporting will be provided to Prometheus and eventually to SDN; alignment to YANG will be considered.

- **Challenge 2: Joint exposure of compute and network metrics for path selection**
	This enhancement to the CODECO framework introduces CATS-aligned path selection capabilities by leveraging [CODECO](https://he-codeco.eu/)’s existing compute and network observability. The goal is to support computing-aware traffic steering across the Edge-Cloud continuum, in line with the architectural direction of IETF CATS. 
  CODECO collects real-time infrastructure metrics -such as CPU , memory usage, latency, and network congestion— from its ACM and NetMA components and aggregates them via the PDLC-CA module into node and cluster scores. These scores are then used to inform microservice placement and potential workload redirection decisions, consistent with CATS principles. 
  The aim is to adapt the current approach to provide scores from PDLC and PDLC-CA to NetMA which may assist in Path ranking and selection based on dynamic network latency and congestion data. 
  This design supports the CATS use case of service instance selection and path steering based on combined compute and network metrics, helping optimize service experience in distributed, heterogeneous edge environments.

- **Challenge 3: Benchmarking Network-aware Edge-Cloud Orchestration with CODEF**
	In alignment with the IETF BMWG's current focus on extending benchmarking methodologies to containerized and cloud-native environments, this initiative proposes the use of the [CODECO](https://he-codeco.eu/) CODEF —an open-source, microservice-driven software-based testbed framework— to evaluate the performance and scalability of edge-cloud orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures. 
  CODEF supports comprehensive benchmarking of native and customized Kubernetes (K8s)-SDN distributions, container networking interfaces (CNIs), and orchestration components under realistic workload conditions. 
  This work directly supports BMWG's objective of providing standardized, reusable methodologies for benchmarking the performance of virtualized and containerized networking solutions in modern, distributed infrastructures. 
  - **Objective**: 
Use the open-source CODEF framework to benchmark and compare the performance of various Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins, including L2S-M, within containerized edge-cloud environments.

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk
  - Rodney Grimes rgrimes@freebsd.org
  - Alistair Woodman awoodman@netdef.org

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on realising ILNP on IPv6.

### Mira: scalable multi-gateway TSCH networking over BLE

- **Champions**:
  Geovane Fedrecheski, geovane.fedrecheski@inria.fr

- **Project Info**

Mira (Micro-robot Interconnect Radio Architecture) is a lightweight, open-source protocol stack that brings multi-gateway Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radios, with support for node-initiated roaming. Mira is a completely new link layer that replaces the BLE controller and host software. Built to support large-scale robot swarms and dense IoT deployments, Mira enables fast handovers, predictable latency, and efficient over-the-air updates.

BLE alone does not scale beyond 5–20 concurrent connections (depending on the stack), Wi-Fi supports more nodes but suffers from collisions and higher power draw, and 6TiSCH offers deterministic communication but lacks native roaming support.

Mira fills this gap by:
- Implementing TSCH directly over the BLE PHY (bypassing the BLE controller and host stack)
- Supporting seamless roaming across multiple gateways without requiring coordination
- Running on widely available hardware (e.g., nRF52840)
- Enabling fast Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) and dense deployments (100+ nodes)

While Thread and BLE Mesh are designed for static home automation using IPv6 over 6LoWPAN or flooding protocols, Mira targets mobile and high-density scenarios—such as robot swarms—where real-time communication, bounded latency, and remote firmware updates are crucial.

At the IETF 123 Hackathon, we aim to:
- Demonstrate a live Mira deployment, including multi-gateway roaming
- Explore how Mira (as a link-layer protocol) can interoperate with upper-layer IETF technologies, including 6LoWPAN, UDP, and CoAP
- Specify/implement a secure association for Mira using IETF technologies such as EDHOC and ELA

We welcome collaboration with anyone working on:
- Low-power networking
- CoAP over BLE or lightweight embedded stacks
- Mobility extensions to 6TiSCH or RPL
- Robotics, swarm testbeds, or dense IoT deployments
