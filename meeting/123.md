## Airport Transportation :airplane:

Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD) is operated by AENA (National Airports Authority), being the bigger one in Spain, 2nd in Europe, and 14th in the world. It has 4 main terminals, which distribute the flights among different airline alliances.

The bigger and most modern terminal, the T4, concentrates all the flights from the Oneworld alliance, and has a Satellite terminal (T4S), for all the non-Schengen flights.

[Official AENA website with all the airport information](http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/index.html).

The 4 main terminals are interconnedted by [free shuttle bus](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/transport-between-terminals.html).

AENA is the national operator for Spanish and many international airports. You can register for free in their [Club](https://clubcliente.aena.es/AenaClub/en/) to obtain free services and discounts within the airports network.

[Alternative non-official information website](https://www.aeropuertomadrid-barajas.com/eng/).

Depending on what terminal you're landing, there are several transport options to reach the venue

There are different bus lines, metro and train. Google Maps offers very good information of all the choices.

- Metro (recommented, faster & cheaper, unless you prefer a taxi)
- Cercanías Train
- Bus
- Taxi

The most efficient method to reach the IETF venue from the Madrid Airport is by Taxi or rideshare service. If you are looking for a more immersive and cost-effective travel method, you can take the local Metro, Train, or Bus system.

If you plan to use the public transport around Madrid, it is recommended to purchase 10-trips or a Multi Public Transport Card for 30 days, which can be just Metro, Bus, Cercanías Train, or combinations of them, so you can save more as much as you use it. All the information available at the [Metro web site](https://www.metromadrid.es/en).

In addition to that, there is also a Tourist Card with unlimited traveling, and different options depending on the number of days (can be further recharged afterwards), which can be purchased at any of the airport terminals. [Complete Information](https://www.crtm.es/billetes-y-tarifas/otras-tarjetas/turistica/?lang=en).

### Metro :metro:

The Madrid Airport is connected to the city of Madrid via the [Pink Metro Line 8](https://www.metromadrid.es/en/linea/linea-8). This line ends at the Nuevos Ministerios Station, where you would need to transfer to the [Dark Blue Metro Line 10](https://www.metromadrid.es/en/linea/linea-10), direction "Hospital Infanta Sofia". The closer station to the Meliá Castilla is "Cuzco" (5 minutes walking to the Melíá Castilla), just 2 stations from Nuevos Ministerios.

The total journey is estimated to be about 40-45 minutes in travel time and will cost 4.50€.

The airport has two metro stations; one at Terminal 2 (T2), floor 1, and the other one at Terminal 4 (T4), floor -1. Both are part of the pink line 8. These lines run 06:00 to 01:30.

### Cercanías Train :train:

Madrid Airport is served by the train line C-1 (light blue), located in Aeropuerto Terminal 4 (T4), floor -1. Take the C1 (light blue) line to the Madrid Chamartin Train Station where you will transfer to the Metro dark Blue Line 10 to the venue (direction Puerta del Sur, stop at Cuzco Station).

You can also use at Madrid Chamartin the Metro light Blue Line 1 direction Valdecarros, stop just at the next Station Plaza de Castilla and walk to ve Meliá Castilla (10 minutes).

Cercanias train tickets are about 2.60€ for a one-way trip and 5.20€ for a return one and can be purchased by the station’s automatic vendors. When buying a ticket, you must use it during the next 2 hours, while the return ticket is valid until the next day. Expect about 45 minutes of travel time including transfers.

[Complete information about the Cercanias network](https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/suburban-madrid).

### Bus :bus:

There is bus service from the airport to Madrid Center, however if you're staying at the Meliá Castilla,is not the best option, even if you will be directly connected to the Metro, or other buses.

Nonetheless, the bus network (EMT) in Madrid is very extensive, and it can be useful specially if you get a Public Transport Card. [Information about the buses](https://www.emtmadrid.es/Bloques-EMT/Aeropuerto.aspx?lang=en-GB).

The most complete information of all the coordinated transports is offered by the CRTM [(Consorcio de Transportes de Madrid)](https://www.crtm.es/tu-transporte-publico/?lang=en).

### Taxi & Rideshare :taxi:

Madrid airport taxis are white taxi vehicles, with red stripes and the city’s emblem on their sides. They are lined up at the airport taxi ranks, no matter the time or day. Each terminal is equipped with two taxi ranks, one at the departures and one at the arrivals level, while passengers are highly advised to hire their cabs exclusively from the official ranks to avoid getting overcharged. 

Madrid taxis are metered. However, the ride from the airport to the Hotel or City Center is set at 35€, even if the transfer takes place during the night or on public holidays. Additionally, luggage isn’t an extra charge. The travel time is about 20-30 minutes, however, could spike up to 40-50 during peak traffic hours. 

Uber, Cabify and Bolt are rideshare services offered in Madrid. The rideshare station at the Madrid Airport is located in the designated passenger pick-up area outside the airport labeled, "VTC/Rideshares."  

### IBERIA Airlines

Iberia Airlines is the [featured air carrier for IETF 123](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/123/featured-airline/), offering IETF attendees a discount on flights to Madrid for IETF 123.

### Immigration, Baggage Reclaim and Customs

Usually inmigration is very fast in Madrid airport. If you're traveling from a country outside the Schengen area and your hold and European Union passport (also if you're citizen of Iceland, Norway or Switzerland), you will be able to use the ABC system (Automatic Border Control). No need for any previous registration.

All the information regarding passport control, baggage reclaim and customs is available at [AENA](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/categories-and-terminals/arrivals-area.html#passportcontrol).

Remember that, to be elegible, you must present your original pasport in the shop.

To obtain a tax refund before leaving the country through airport customs, non-EU residents can apply for an early refund by completing the procedures at major shopping centers, at offices in the city center, or even from their smartphone using an [app](https://www.globalblue.com/en/shoppers/mobile-customer-care).

Regardless, as indicated above in the VAT Refund section, visitors must validate their purchases at the airport's DIVA kiosk by presenting the forms provided by the shop.

There are several tax-free operators on the market.

## Food recommendations, not to miss while you're in Spain
Included links to recipes, so you can have a look to the ingredients. Please note that there maybe differences depending on each chef, so double check with the restaurant in case you have any dietary restrictions or intolerances.

### Cold Soups
- [Gazpacho](https://spanishsabores.com/recipe-gazpacho-andaluz/#ingredients). Refreshing and only vegetable (mainly tomato). There are unlimited variations with melon, watermelon, strawberry, mango, cherry, roasted vegetables, ...
- [Salmorejo](https://spanishsabores.com/antonias-salmorejo-recipe/). Very similar to gazpacho, however it may have non-vegetable ingredients, such as boiled eggs and spanish ham. There are some variations, for example using [beet](https://spanishsabores.com/cold-beet-soup-recipe-beet-salmorejo/).
- [Ajo Blanco](https://spanishsabores.com/ajo-blanco-recipe-chilled-almond-soup/). Mainly almonds, garlic and bread.

### Warm Soups
You will be able to find many offering for warm soups, not just vegetables, but also fish and seafood soups. A must try is  [Sopa de ajo o sopa Castellana](https://www.bascofinefoods.com/spanish-recipes/sopa-de-ajo/), for instance to recharge your batteries after a night of partying.

### Salads or so ...
Not sure if everybody will considered them as a salad. They can be a dish on their own, or tapas, better order several of them and share!
Some of them can have only vegetables, check with the chef.
Some can be served warm or hot, even as side of a main dish.
- [Ensaladilla rusa](https://spanishsabores.com/ensaladilla-rusa-recipe-russian-potato-salad/). It can have tuna or belly (not just from tuna). Some times they can have also shrimps.
- [Ensalada campera](https://bake-street.com/en/ensalada-campera-country-salad/).
- [Ensalada de alubias](https://www.mediterrasian.com/delicious_recipes_spanish_white_bean_salad.htm).
- [Ensalada de judias verdes y patatas](https://www.food.com/recipe/spanish-green-beans-with-potatoes-342589).
- [Samfaina](https://cookpad.com/eng/recipes/2615298). Commonly served with fried eggs.
- [Pisto](https://spanishsabores.com/traditional-spanish-pisto-recipe/). Commonly served with fried eggs as well.
- [Escalivada](https://www.carolinescooking.com/escalivada-catalan-roasted-vegetables/).
- [Patatas bravas](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/the-ultimate-patatas-bravas). So many variations of the recipe, almost every restaurant, bar or chef has its own!
- [Patatas alioli](https://spanishsabores.com/patatas-alioli-recipe/).
- [Tumbet](https://spanishsabores.com/mallorcan-tumbet-recipe/).

### Paella, Rice, others
Instead of [paella](https://spanishsabores.com/what-is-paella/) I prefer to talk about "spanish rice (arroz) dishes" as there are many versions or the paella. My recommendation is to try:
- [Arroz negro (black rice)](https://spanishsabores.com/black-paella-recipe/). Mainly rice, squid (including a small portion of its ink) and prawns. A must to have it with "all i oli" (Garlic and Oil mayonnaise, no egg).
- [Paella del senyoret](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/arroz-senoret).
- [Arroz abanda](https://spainonafork.com/spanish-seafood-rice-arroz-a-banda-recipe/).
- [Arroz meloso](https://spanishsabores.com/seafood-rice-recipe/). 

If instead of rice you prefer pasta, try the [fideuá](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/how-to-make-fideua). Similar cookings as the rice dishes, replacing the rice with cut vermicelli.

### Meat
In Spain there is a big variety of high quality meat and all kind of preparations, some of them are specialities from different regions. You will find beef, pork, lamb, poultry and game meats in most of the restaurants.

### Fish and Sea Food
Similarly, commonly available high quailty fish are seabass, turbot, monkfish, cod, hake and sole. As in the case of the meat, there are many specialities in each Spanish region.

### Tapas, pintxos or complete dishes?
All the dishes in this section can be just a simple tapa or pintxo, but also a very complete dish on their own. Of couse, you want to try them all, so better order as tapas to share and enjoy tasting them with your colleagues!
