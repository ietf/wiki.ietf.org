   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#projects-included-in-hackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)

{.links-list}

## Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

- **Project Info**
Test interoperability of Post Quantum algorithms in x.509 structures (Certificates, keys, CMS and other drafts).   This project started in November 2022 and continues to evolve.  We currently have github automated tooling that automatically tests submitted artifacts allowing implementations to get immediate feedback on their compatibility. This allows us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

At IETF 125, we plan to add more automation and others are invited to test interoperability.  Also, the composite signatures recently had IANA OIDs assigned, so a number of people are interested in testing composite signatures interoperability.

- **Project Info**
YANG2API refers to a mechanism that converts YANG data models into APIs. It enables operators to expose YANG-based network and service abstractions to external systems, thereby better supporting dynamic, short-lived operational needs or heterogeneous environments. To improve consistency and reduce integration friction,  it is important to explore how to efficiently integrate IETF YANG data models with externally developed frameworks via YANG2API, such as TMF640. Based on the YANG2API tool jointly developed, this project will investigate the effectiveness of transforming existing mainstream network and service abstractions into APIs, discuss and evaluate identified issues in the process with partners. The purpose of this project is to explore mature patterns for exposing YANG-based abstractions to external applications.

- **Hackathon Plan**
1.Design and implement a lightweight YANG2API environment engine that automatically generates directly callable upper-layer APIs by parsing YANG models defined in IETF standards.
2.Develop a demonstration program to showcase the automated conversion and provisioning of L3VPN and other models, verify the generated APIs by invoking them in Swagger UI, and observe the real-time generation of Netconf messages in the backend.

### Optimizing Agent Context Interaction
- **Champions**
Zeze Chang (changzeze@huawei.com)
Shuping Peng (pengshuping@huawei.com)

- **Project Info**
Multi-agent collaboration has been widely studied as an effective approach for addressing complex and multi-turn interactive tasks. However, in current agentic workflows, contextual information is often exchanged in an unstructured and redundant manner, leading to excessive token consumption, increased execution latency, and reduced task completion success rates, especially in multi-step and multi-agent scenarios. The project focuses on designing and experimenting with structured agent context interaction mechanisms, including precise context distribution, context isolation among agents, and fine-grained task and progress management. A master–invoked agent interaction scheme is expected to demonstrate how task-related contexts can be selectively delivered to invoked agents and incrementally updated during task execution.

- **Hackathon Plan**
1.	Design and implement a multi-agent context interaction framework based on the structured context schemas defined in the draft.
2.	Develop a demo to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed agent context interaction mechanism.

### Agent Communication Gateway for Semantic Routing and Working Memory
- **Champions**
Xiaohui Xie (xiexiaohui@tsinghua.edu.cn)
Zian Wang (zianwang@bupt.edu.cn)
Tianshuo Hu (huts22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)
- **Project Info**
As multi-agent systems are increasingly used for complex, multi-step interactive tasks, the way agents exchange context has become a key bottleneck: in many current agentic workflows, context is transmitted in an unstructured, redundant, and broadcast-like manner, which causes excessive token consumption, higher latency, and lower task success rates—especially when multiple agents are orchestrated across multiple steps. This project proposes and prototypes an Agent Communication Gateway that sits between agents and tools/services, providing two core capabilities: Semantic Routing, which intelligently routes messages/contexts to the most relevant agent(s) or tool endpoints based on semantic intent, task state, and routing policies to reduce unnecessary fan-out and duplicated context delivery; and Gateway Memory, which maintains structured, scoped memory (e.g., per-task / per-agent / per-session) to support selective context retrieval, context compression/summarization, and incremental updates, enabling agents to receive only the context they need at each step while preserving long-horizon task continuity.

- **Hackathon Plan**
    1. Design and implement a lightweight agent communication gateway with (a) semantic routing policies and (b) structured working memory.
    2. Integrate the gateway into a simple multi-agent workflow and validate that context delivery becomes more selective and less redundant.
    3. Develop a demo to showcase improvements such as reduced token usage, reduced latency, and improved task completion stability.

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a self-configuring mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a [brief presentation about Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s) at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/proceedings#iab). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/). This Hackathon event is open to all — Thread Group membership is *not* required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate.

- **Project Info**
In recent years, AI agents have witnessed remarkable progress and are increasingly recognized as a pivotal force in various fields. Regarding agent protocols, they play a crucial role in enabling seamless communication between agents, external tools, and data sources. However, with the development of AI agents and their protocols, security has become a pressing concern.
We continue to work on to implement and test security aspects of AI agent protocol. This hackathon, we test authorisation procedures on Model Context Protocol.
