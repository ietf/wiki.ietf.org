## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#projects-included-in-hackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#projects-included-in-hackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](/meeting/124/hackathon/hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.

## Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

## Projects Included in Hackathon
<!-- Use #projects-included-in-hackathon in your links to go directly this section! -->

*Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for those who are new to the IETF or new to the Hackathon. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. `*`. If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a `*` at the end of your project name.*

### High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WAN)
- **Champions**
Quan Xiong (xiong.quan@zte.com.cn)
Daniel King (d.king@lancaster.ac.uk)
Tim Chown (tim.chown@jisc.ac.uk)
- **Project Info**
High-performance WAN (HP-WAN) is designed specifically to meet the high-speed, low-latency, and high-capacity needs of data-intensive applications and enable the host-and-network collaboration for the high-speed and high-throughput data transmission, coupled with fast completion time.

- **Hackathon Plan**
1.HPWAN deployment on topologies for public networks and service scenarios based on the HP-WAN framework
2.Learn about HPWAN developments and open-source controllers and orchestrators for integrated HPWAN connection management (IETF RestConf/NetConf/YANG)
3.Integration and simulation of the HP-WAN functions, such as the rate negotiation, admission control, traffic scheduling, and resource reservations with distributed signalling  (IETF RSVP-TE)
4.Perform the CC algorithms optimizations (e.g. DCQCN algorithm) to simulate the traffic transmission with negotiated rates and compare with the HPWAN approach
5.Work on improvements to IETF protocols and models for cooperation between HPWAN domains.

### YANG2API
- **Champions**
Chongfeng Xie (xiechf@chinatelecom.cn)
Wenbin Yu (yuwb6@chinatelecom.cn)

- **Project Info**
YANG2API refers to a mechanism that converts YANG data models into APIs. It enables operators to expose YANG-based network and service abstractions to external systems, thereby better supporting dynamic, short-lived operational needs or heterogeneous environments. When deploying YANG2API, it is important to explore how to efficiently integrate IETF YANG data models with externally developed frameworks, such as TMF640, in order to improve consistency and reduce integration friction.

### YANG Data Model for Network Inventory (IVY)
- **Champions**
Yanxia Tan (tanyx11@chinaunicom.cn)
Haomian Zheng (zhenghaomian@huawei.com)

- **Project Info**
Network inventory management is a fundamental functional block in the overall network management. It is a critical part for ensuring that the network remains healthy, well planned, and maintained appropriately to meet the operational objectives. Also, it allows operators to keep track of all the components deployed in their networks, including relevant embedded software and hardware. The scope of this project is to evaluate the implementation of ivy WG data models. The base model is assumed to be technology-agnostic, and could be augmented with application- and technology-specific details.

- **Hackathon Plan**
1.Inventory model verification, verifying the usability and interoperability of the model specified in the draft.
2.Learn and discuss other ivy draft and data models related to network inventory management.

- **Project Info**
SRv6 END.IL is a variant of the SRv6 End behavior, an SRv6 END.IL SID steers packets to a remote network node via an underlay network connection. SRv6 END.IL behavior can be used for SRv6 based inter-layer path programming and traffic engineering, so as to provide differentiated and guaranteed performance for different services. 

- **Hackathon Plan**
1.Learn about the background and key protocol mechanism of SRv6 END.IL;
2.Demonstrate multi-vendor interworking networking and perform testing for SRv6 END.IL;
3.Validate service connectivity and performance guarantee in SRv6 END.IL interworking scenarios;
4.Review the current SRv6 END.IL draft, propose necessary updates and future related work in IETF.
