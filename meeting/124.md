### Immigration, Baggage Reclaim and Customs

You can complete your customs and immigration declaration even before you get to YUL. Advance Declaration, which is available on the ArriveCAN application ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/arrivecan/id1505394667) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.gc.cbsa.coronavirus&hl=en)) and offered by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), allows you to fill out your declaration up to 72 hours before your flight, saving you time as you leave the airport.

Check the display boards to find out which baggage carousel number has been assigned to your flight. Luggage carts are available in this area if you need one. You can also ask a luggage porter to help you.

The airline is responsible for delivering your luggage. For missing or damaged luggage, or any other related issue, you need to go to your airline’s luggage service counter, located just before the luggage claim exit.

**Handing in your declaration card**

Before exiting to the public area, you need to present your declaration card to a Canada Border Services Agency officer, who will advise you if you need to undergo a secondary inspection. This consists of a manual luggage inspection and, in some cases, a search.

**Late or lost luggage**

The luggage claim service counter is located on the international arrivals level, at the end of the corridor, in front of gate 28. Use one of the telephones to speak to an attendant and get information about retrieving your luggage.
