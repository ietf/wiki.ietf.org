## Airport Transportation
[Vienna International Airport (VIE)](https://www.viennaairport.com/en/passengers)
[Airport Taxi Information](https://www.viennaairport.com/en/passengers/arrival__parking/taxis__limousines)
### Public Train
- S7 / REX7 (commuter rail) directly to "Wien Mitte" (Vienna Central) - 19 minutes with REX7, 23 minutes with S7, intervals around 30 minutes.
- REX/ICE via Vienna Main Station (Hauptbahnhof) and S-Bahn (towards Floridsdorf) to "Wien Mitte"
Cost: € 4,80 (2 Zone Tickets), €4,60 (point-to-point ticket) one way.

VOR ticketed trains are running at 03, 11, 19, 33, 41 and 46 minutes past the hour.

Ticket vending machines are located at the airport when walking towards the train platform in the sub-basement, or (better) in the main arrival hall to the right, next to the ramp leading down towards the train platforms. There should also be a staffed ticket shop in that vicinity.

Online pre-paid tickets: https://shop.vor.at/

### [City Airport Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Airport_Train)
N.B. The [CAT public website](https://www.cityairporttrain.com/en/home) presently states that the CAT trains are not running again until the 29th of March. Inbound travel from the airport by train will require the use of the other services, described above.

CAT trains depart at the airport (when running) at 08 and 38 min past top of the hour. (See below for other trains)

CAT Services are currently suspended, but it is not unreasonable to expect that to resume by the time of the IETF.

Taking CAT, any Airport Luggage can be checked in directly at the train station Wien Mitte, on departure.

A two-way ticket on the CAT is priced €19 (online prepurchase) / €21 (vending machine) - and you may get Miles on a Miles&More (United, Star Alliance) card.

(note that CAT trains are only a few minutes faster than VOR / ÖBB trains, but they don't have an intermediate stop. On the way out to the Airport, however, the CAT allows you to drop your checked luggage already at Wien Mitte station).

## Public transport
### Service:

The public transport network covering the larger vienna area is VOR (Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region), the local network in Vienna is "Wiener Linien", and consists of Metro lines, Trams, Buses. It's reliable, safe, quite cheap, and an "open" system (no gates - infrequent ticket checks in trains and stations). Most major lines (particularly the metro lines) run between 5:30 and shortly after midnight - intervals down to 2 minutes during rush hour. During weekday nights, there's a "night bus" service at intervals of 30 minutes. The metro runs through the whole night before Sat and Sun to cater for the nightlife at 15 min interval. Standard tickets are valid for night services.

### Multi-Day / Week tickets are available:

(tl;dr: I'd highly recommend a weekly ticket if you plan using public transport for the whole week https://www.wienerlinien.at/eportal3/ep/channelView.do/pageTypeId/66533/channelId/-47399 - additional zones required for the airport legs.)

VOR ticket can be calculated and prepaid here:

https://shop.vor.at/

Price for a single trip Airport-City using VOR €4,80 (or €9,60 for both ways) - slightly more expensive that a point-to-point only ticket (€4,60)

If you plan to use public transport in the city throughout the week, you can combine a single-trip ticket (airport to city limits) with a 2-day, 3-day, 8-day (non-consecutive), week (consecutive) or monthly pass valid in the city center:

https://preisauskunft.vor.at/current/index.html

- 48h ticket: €14.1
- 72h ticket: €17.1
- 1 week ticket: €17.1 (ends on Monday 9:00 morning the week after invalidation)

All the above tickets are not personalized and can be used (at different times) by a different person.

- 8 day ticket: €40.8 (each day needs to be invalidated individually. Multiple persons can "share" this ticket but have to travel as a group.
- Month's pass €51 (I believe this one is only valid for a specifc person, and has to be bought in a VOR ticket shop - located at major stations such as Wien Mitte (IETF Venue).

The least cost option to cover the week of the IETF is probably: 1 single ticket (€2.4) airport to city limits 48/72hr/week ticket within city limits until Monday 09:00 (14.1/17.1) 1 week ticket coverig the actual IETF week (17.1) 1 single ticket returning to the airport (on top of the still valid week ticket) (€2.4)

Total cost €39 arriving between Mon 14.3 .. Fri 18.3, or €36 arriving Sat/Sun? 19.3 / 20.3, or €21.9 arriving Mon 21.3.

## General Guides
(besides the usual tourist franchises)

- https://viennawurstelstand.com/ - english-written site geared at expats, though even we locals enjoy reading the "secret" tips there.
- https://www.1000things.at/ - similar site, though primarily in german
- https://www.diefruehstueckerinnen.at/stadt/wien/ - specialized on breakfast / brunch options in vienna, mostly german as well, though.
- https://www.visitingvienna.com/entertainment/march/ - list of events / things to do in March in Vienna.
## Restaurants
**Tipping:** 10% of the total bill on small bills is perfectly fine, even less on larger bills. For example, if the bill is 21,40€, a total of 23€ or 24€ would be perfectly fine. For a bill like 83€, 90€ would be reasonable (given the service was ok!). When splitting the bill, everybody is expected to do their own tipping. Tipping in Austria works like this: The waiter announces (or hands you) the amount ("21,80 for you"), and you hand the waiter the money (or the card), and announce the total sum ("make it 23€").

**Places to eat:** (not exhaustive!)

To get a decent Viennese Schnitzel or [Tafelspitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafelspitz) - these places are slightly upscale:

Walking up "Landstrasser Hauptstrasse" is [Rochusmarkt](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d11873003-Reviews-Rochusmarkt-Vienna.html), An open air market with a few options to sit down for a snack or small meal - weather permitting (some stalls do have few tables indoor as well).

Other "non austrian" fare options (most are quick and budget-friendly):

Fine Dining nearby: (Reservations required!)

- Steirereck https://www.steirereck.at/ (Austria's best Restaurant according to Falstaff) - Walking distance in the Stadtpark, expect to be set back by 200+ € for a dinner per person
- Meierei https://www.steirereck.at/en/meierei/ is in the same building as Steirereck ("downstairs"), and features similar kitchen for a smaller budget. Also, it is more relaxed than Steirereck - suitable for a business lunch.
- Lingenhel https://www.lingenhel.com/ is an interesting new "restaurant side business" of a small gourmet food shop in walking distance to the hilton. They only have 7 tables, so some pre-planning is required. Not cheap, but worth the money!

## Weather
[Current weather conditions in Vienna, Austria](https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=17)

## Shopping
Opening hours are typically 10am - 7pm for non-amenity shops during the week, and 10am-6pm on Saturday. Almost all shops are closed on Sunday. Nearby options:

- Wien Mitte Mall (right across the Hilton). The Mall includes an electronics shop ("Mediamarkt") that will cater for your USB charging cable etc. requirements, as well as seperate shops for amenities. Also, a small supermarket ("Spar Pronto") there is also open on Sundays.
- Thalia - medium sized Book shop right across the Wien Mitte Mall, including an English section - they also stock some office supplies. Notably, this is also open on Sundays.
- Landstrasser Haupstrasse is lined with shops
- 'Mariahilfer Strasse' ("Mahü") is Vienna's main shopping drag (Busy on Saturday!). The side streets feature many smaller indie shops, particularly Neubaugasse, Lindengasse, Zollergasse - and are dotted with Cafes.
- 'Graben' and particularly 'Kohlmarkt' host upscale boutiques. "Meinl am Graben" there is Vienna's finest supermarket.
- 'Naschmarkt' is Vienna's most well known (and most touristy) open-air market. "Dr. Falafel" there is an institution for a quick veggie bite :)
- 'Shopping City Süd' is Vienna's largest Mall (though, technically, it's outside city limits already - access is only pratical by car).
## Sports
- Swimming: Public pools are reasonably priced, though none are in walking distance. ​Stadthallenbad features the only 50m indoor pool in the city. ​Amalienbad is an architectural jewel from the 1920s that could easily be featured in a Wes Anderson movie. Brave souls might also grab their wetsuits and jump into ​Alte Donau.
- Running: ​Stadtpark right across the Hilton is suitable for short rounds. ​Donaukanal is another, Graffiti-lined popular nearby option. ​The 'Green Prater' is about 1km away and a prime running spot. more options: ​https://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/sports/jogging-walking-349378
## Geekery
