<h2 class="toc-header" id="transportation交通需知"> Transportation（交通需知）</h2>
<p>We understand that traveling abroad can be both exciting and a bit overwhelming, especially when facing language differences. In China, most airports and train stations provide English sign, which will help guide you to taxi waiting area, shuttle bus areas, and other key locations. If you find that signs are unclear or insufficient, don’t hesitate to approach a nearby service desk for assistance — staff are generally helpful and accustomed to assisting international travelers.</p>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="airport-transportation-机场出行"> Airport Transportation <img src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/2708.svg" alt="✈️" draggable="false" class="emoji">（机场出行）</h2>
<p>There are three major airports near the Shenzhen area, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport (SZX), Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN) and Hong Kong International Airport (HKG).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You might need to save in phone or print out the Chinese name of your hotel or other destination, when taking taxi, in case that driver can’t understand English. (Such as Shangri-La Hotel in Chinese: 深圳福田香格里拉酒店.)</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="baoan-international-airportszx"> Bao’an International Airport（SZX)</h3>
<p>For guests arriving at Bao’an International Airport, you may take a taxi, Metro, or airport shuttle bus to reach downtown Shenzhen. The estimated fee for a taxi or DiDi from Bao’an airport waiting area to the Shangri-La Hotel (Futian) is between 100 and 150 RMB, depending on the time of arrival and traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Taking the metro costs approximately 5–10 RMB. You can take Metro Line 11 in the direction of Huaqiangnan (华强南). The ride takes about 35 minutes, passing through 8 stops before arriving at Futian Station (福田站). From Futian station, it’s about a 15-minute walk (approximately 900 meters) to reach the Shangri-La Hotel.</p>
<p>The Bao’an Airport shuttle bus also provides direct service to the Futian District. You can take the NA1 Futian Line (福田线) and get off at the second stop: Touzi Mansion (投资大厦). From there, it’s about an 8-minute walk (approximately 550 meters) to reach the Shangri-La Hotel.</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="guangzhou-baiyun-airportcan"> Guangzhou Baiyun Airport（CAN)</h3>
<p>For guests arriving at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, you can travel to downtown Shenzhen by high-speed train or airport shuttle bus. Train tickets can be purchased online via the official 12306 platform.</p>
<p>We highly recommend booking a train that arrives at Futian Station (福田站) in Shenzhen, as it is only about a 13-minute walk (approximately 800 meters) to the Shangri-La Hotel. However, tickets for this route tend to sell out quickly, so we suggest booking 1 to 2 weeks in advance. If tickets to Futian are unavailable, there are usually plenty of trains from Baiyun Airport to other stations in Shenzhen. From those stations, you may need to take a taxi or DiDi to reach the hotel. Most high-speed train tickets for this route cost between 60 to 80 RMB.</p>
<p>The airport shuttle bus at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport also offers service the route to Futian, Shenzhen. Please choose the shuttle line heading to Futian Port (福田口岸). The trip takes approximately 2.5 to 3 hours and costs around 120–150 RMB. Once you arrive at Futian Port, you can take a taxi or DiDi to the Shangri-La Hotel, which takes about 15 minutes and costs around 15 RMB.</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="hongkong-international-airport-hkg"> Hongkong International airport (HKG)</h3>
<p>For the guest who arrive at Hongkong international airport, you can choose either the train or taxi to go to downtown Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Taking a Hong Kong taxi from Hong Kong International Airport to Futian Port can be a time-saving option, but the fare is typically around 250–300 HKD. Please note that some Hongkong taxis only accept cash in HKD, so it is advisable to withdraw cash in advance using the ATM machines at the airport. Hong Kong taxis are only permitted to drop passengers off at Futian Port and cannot enter Shenzhen, which means you will need to transfer to a Shenzhen taxi or DiDi from the Futian port to reach the Shangri-La Hotel, the second taxi ride takes approximately 15 minutes and costs around 15 RMB.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can take a taxi from Hong Kong International Airport to West Kowloon train station, then purchase a high-speed train ticket to Futian Station (福田站), which costs about 70 – 80 HKD. Ticket can be purchase on <a class="is-external-link" href="http://Trip.com">Trip.com</a> with passport information. The train ride takes approximately 15 minutes and is a highly efficient cross-border option. Once you arrive at Futian Station, it is about a 13-minute walk (roughly 800 meters) to the Shangri-La Hotel.</p>
<p>There are several minivan transfer services available at HKG that can take you directly to your hotel in Shenzhen. You can either book online in advance or make an in-person inquiry at the travel service counters located in the HKG arrival hall. The fare typically ranges from 300 to 500 HKD or RMB, depending on the travel company and type of minivan. It is recommended to travel with at least two or more partner to make the service more cost-effective.</p>
