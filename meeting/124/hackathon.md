## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](/meeting/124/hackathon/hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

## <a id="ProjectsIncludedinHackathon"></a>Projects Included in Hackathon

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for those who are new to the IETF or new to the Hackathon. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. *. *If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a * at the end of your project name.*

### <a id="Thread"></a>Low-Power Wireless IPv6 Networking with Thread *
- **Champion**
Stuart Cheshire &lt;cheshire@apple.com&gt;

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a self-configuring mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a [brief presentation about Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s) at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/proceedings#:~:text=iabopen). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/). This Hackathon event is open to all — Thread Group membership is *not* required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate.

- **Participants and Project Info**
  - To avoid taking up too much space on the main Hackathon page, Thread participants and projects are listed separately on the [Thread Projects page](/meeting/124/hackathon/thread-projects).

### Space Networking/TIPTOP Experiment
- **Champion**
Marc Blanchet &lt;marc.blanchet@viagenie.ca&gt;

- ** Objectives **

Space communications have large delays (2 secs one-way delay to Moon, 4-22 mins to Mars) and intermittence (because relay orbiters going on the other side of the celestial body). The key adaptations to make to the IP stacks are (briefly, see drafts for details) - for forwarders facing intermittence, store temporarily packets instead of dropping them, when a link goes down - adjust transport and application timers. The [TIPTOP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tiptop/about/) working group is making group progress on specifications. The purpose of this experiment is to start trying early implementations and get experience on using applications in this environment.

- ** Project Info **

We will be broadcasting two SSID on the hackathon wireless network: ietf-moon which will inject a 2 seconds one-way delay and ietf-mars which will inject a 4 minutes delay. Both will also see intermittence.  Everybody is very welcome to participate and test the network, but make sure to follow the [instructions](https://deepspaceip.github.io/meeting/ietf124/README.md) as typical Internet applications won't work as is in this environment.

    + Matt Joras (mjoras@meta.com)
    + Marcus Ihlar (marcus.ihlar@ericsson.com)
    + Zahed Sarker (zahed.sarker.ietf@gmail.com)

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti &lt;saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk&gt;
  - Rodney Grimes &lt;rgrimes@freebsd.org&gt;
  - Alistair Woodman &lt;awoodman@netdef.org&gt;

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on realising ILNP on IPv6.

    - Intra-handshake attestation ([Internet draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fossati-tls-attestation/))
    - Post-handshake attestation ([Internet draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fossati-tls-exported-attestation/) and Sec. 4 in [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367284929_SoK_Attestation_in_Confidential_Computing))
  - **Hackathon plan**
  	- Discuss the nits of [identity crisis](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/Jx_yPoYWMIKaqXmPsytKZBDq23o/)
    - Discuss possible solutions
    - Discuss open issues
	    - What is the "long-term identity" of the CC workload? How is "long-term identity" assigned to the CC workload? Which entity supplies this "long-term identity"? How is that Identity Supplier trusted?
		- How is CA-certified Long-Term Key (LTK) injected in the Confidential Computing workload in the first place?
  - We aim to seek collaborators (knowledgeable about at least one of the following: TLS, remote attestation, formal methods or confidential computing) who will join us in this project. We also welcome reviewers who can give us feedback on the draft. If you are interested, please contact by email. 
  - Tool for formal analysis: We currently use ProVerif but other tools are very welcome.
