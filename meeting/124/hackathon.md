## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](/meeting/124/hackathon/hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

### <a id="Thread"></a>Low-Power Wireless IPv6 Networking with Thread *
- **Champion**
Stuart Cheshire &lt;cheshire@apple.com&gt;

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a self-configuring mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a [brief presentation about Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s) at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/proceedings#:~:text=iabopen). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/). This Hackathon event is open to all — Thread Group membership is *not* required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate.

- **Participants and Project Info**
  - To avoid taking up too much space on the main Hackathon page, Thread participants and projects are listed separately on the [Thread Projects page](/meeting/124/hackathon/thread-projects).

### Space Networking/TIPTOP Experiment
- **Champion**
Marc Blanchet &lt;marc.blanchet@viagenie.ca&gt;

- **Objectives**

Space communications have large delays (2 secs one-way delay to Moon, 4-22 mins to Mars) and intermittence (because relay orbiters going on the other side of the celestial body). The key adaptations to make to the IP stacks are (briefly, see drafts for details) - for forwarders facing intermittence, store temporarily packets instead of dropping them, when a link goes down - adjust transport and application timers. The [TIPTOP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tiptop/about/) working group is making group progress on specifications. The purpose of this experiment is to start trying early implementations and get experience on using applications in this environment.

- **Project Info**

We will be broadcasting two SSID on the hackathon wireless network: ietf-moon which will inject a 2 seconds one-way delay and ietf-mars which will inject a 4 minutes delay. Both will also see intermittence.  Everybody is very welcome to participate and test the network, but make sure to follow the [instructions](https://deepspaceip.github.io/meeting/ietf124/README.md) as typical Internet applications won't work as is in this environment.

### <a id="scone"></a>SCONE - Standard Communication with Network Elements

    + Matt Joras (mjoras@meta.com)
    + Marcus Ihlar (marcus.ihlar@ericsson.com)
    + Zahed Sarker (zahed.sarker.ietf@gmail.com)

- **Project Info**

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti &lt;saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk&gt;
  - Rodney Grimes &lt;rgrimes@freebsd.org&gt;
  - Alistair Woodman &lt;awoodman@netdef.org&gt;

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on realising ILNP on IPv6.

### AI-network: Data and Agent Aware Inference and Training Network (DA-ITN)

- **Champion**

  - Maryam Hosseini   (maryam.hosseini3@huawei.com)
  - Hesham Moussa     (Hesham.moussa@huawei.com)
  - Arashmid Akhavain (arashmid.akhavain@huawei.com)

 - **Project Info**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping industries and daily life, driven by advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek. These models have demonstrated the transformative potential of AI across diverse applications, from productivity tools to complex decision-making systems. However, the effectiveness and reliability of AI hinge on two foundational processes: training and inference.  Each presents unique challenges related to data management, computation, connectivity, privacy, trust, security, and governance.  **In this project, we introduce the Data and Agent Aware-Inference and Training Network (DA-ITN) framework — a unified, intelligent, multi-plane network architecture designed to address the full spectrum of AI system requirements.** The architecture features dedicated control, data, and operations & management (OAM) planes to orchestrate training, inference, and agentic services while ensuring reliability, transparency, and accountability. 

In this demo, we will be showcasing the first look into a concept that we refer to as **data descriptors**. These are unique extractions collected from data available for training and can be used to guide the all of the AI services that the DA-ITN enables. As an exampled, we will be demonstrating how these data descriptors are used to facilitate efficient sequential training of a model across a knowledge sharing network that consists of a number of connected data nodes and an orchestrator.

  - GUANMING ZENG (zengguanming@huawei.com)
  - LEI QI     (qilei1@huawei.com)
  - YUN LIANG (liangyun25@huawei.com)

- **Project Info**
  - The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that provides a standardized way to connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to data sources and tools. This project investigates the application of MCP in network management to create a decoupled, agile architecture for exposing network capabilities as tools for AI agents. It enables intent-based network operations, closed-loop automation, and fosters an ecosystem for innovation by allowing third-party AI applications to interact with network functions seamlessly.
  - This Hackathon project brings together MCP client and server implementations to test and demonstrate their use in network management, including network exposure and integration with existing protocols and data models. We have successfully integrated CLI with MCP, and our next phase will focus on integrating YANG interfaces.

### Multi-modal Knowledge Graph for Network Management
- **Champions**
Mingzhe Xing  xingmz@zgclab.edu.cn

Yujia Gao     gaoyj@zgclab.edu.cn
- **Project Info**
The Problem: Network management are getting more complex, coming from many different data sources and large scale networks. Traditional network management systems struggle to keep up, and while AI models like GPT are great with language, they don't understand the specific logic of network management well enough to be truly effective.
Our Hackathon Solution: We built MMKG, an intelligent defense system that acts like a network expert's brain. It connects the power of large language models (LLMs) with a structured knowledge base built specifically for understanding network requirements.
How It Works:
- The "Operator Brain" (Knowledge Graph): We created a pipeline that automatically builds a unified knowledge graph from diverse textual data sources. This graph understands the relationships between different terms.
- Speaking the Language of Networks (PCAPBERT): We developed a custom AI model that translates raw network traffic data into meaningful, semantic embeddings. This allows our system to "understand" network packets in context.
- The Intelligent Reasoning Engine (KGRAG): This is the core of our project. It uses our knowledge graph to provide the LLM with accurate, structured, and causally consistent information. This supercharges the LLM, enabling it to perform complex network management tasks with high reliability.

### Semantic Routing-Driven Secure and Scalable Multi-Agent Communication

- **Champions**
  Chenguang Du (ducg@zgclab.edu.cn)
  Yihan Chao (chaoyh@zgclab.edu.cn)
  Mingzhe Xing (xingmz@mail.zgclab.edu.cn)

- **Project Info**

  As the number of AI agents grows quickly, new problems appear: **how to find, verify, and use the right agent safely among thousands of similar ones**. Today’s task planners often use fixed agent lists, which are hard to update and can cause unsafe or incorrect tool calls.

  This project builds a **semantic routing middleware** — an intelligent layer that connects *agent intentions* with the *right capability endpoint* using semantic understanding and safety checks.

  1. **Semantic Routing Engine:** Turns each task request into a semantic vector and searches a database of agent capabilities. It uses two steps — *semantic recall and fine re-ranking* — to pick the most relevant and reliable agent quickly.
  2. **Scalable and Decoupled Architecture:** Separates the task planning logic from the actual execution. The planner does not need to know all agents; it just asks the router, which returns the best endpoint and example parameters. New agents can join easily without changing the planner.
  3. **Safety and Trust Control:** Checks every agent for safety and reliability before use. The system filters out unsafe or fake agents using trust data such as capability proofs, past performance, and security ratings.

We propose an extension for SCITT as an **A YANG Data Model for Multi-Statements** to provide integrated Supply Chain information for the computer system protection. 
During the hachathon, we will solicit additional adaptable use cases and explore flexible YANG models that complement area not coverd by exisitang Supply Chain Security specifications.
However, we will take care **not to impact the ongoing RFC making work for the pioneering SCITT Architecture and SCITT SCRAPI**. 
Upon discovering the SCITT and RATS tables, attempt to join them to facilitate consensus-building discussions. 

- **Hackathon Work Item**
  - Looking for SCITT tables in Hackathon room

- **Project Info**
The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) mechanism is a framework that reduces protocol overhead in IoT environments, where computing resources are limited (little memory or processing power, large battery life-span constraints, ...).
As its name suggests, SCHC relies on a static shared context, or set of rules, to be able to compress and decompress network packets. This is a challenge in highly dynamic or constantly evolving network traffic.
The CORECONF (CoAP Management Interface) standard is a promising means to manage client/server resources and configurations in constrined networks.
We propose extending the SCHC framework with rule and context management capabilities through CORECONF, to make it possible to adapt SCHC rules on the fly.

Test interoperability of Post Quantum algorithms in x.509 structures (Certificates, keys, CMS and other drafts).   This project started in November 2022 and continues to evolve.  We currently have some github automated actions to automaticlaly test submitted artifacts allowing implementations to get immedidate feedback on their compatibility. This allows us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

At IETF 124, we plan to add more automation and others are invited to test interoperability.  Also, the composite signatures recently had IANA OIDs assigned, so a number of people are interested in testing composite signatures interoperability.   

### Remote Attestation with Exported Authenticators

- **Project Info**
Deployment of Remote Attestation (RA) in the field is complicated by a lack of standard mechanisms to help combine it with existing protocols. Most notable is the lack of any widely-deployed approach to leveraging PKI and RA together to set up a secure channel. The newly minted [Secure Evidence and Attestation Transport (SEAT) WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/seat/about/) aims to standardize solutions in this space. The Remote Attestation with Exported Authenticators (draft-fossati-seat-expat) draft is meant to provide a solution for integrating RA into a TLS stack. This hackathon project deals with producing working code for draft-fossati-seat-expat.

RADIUS has had 30 years of protocol issues.  The existing specifications say that servers must discard well-formed, authentic, packets from known clients.  There are no provisions for rate limiting packets.  In many cases, packets are sent and never see a reply, which contributes to network instability.

We want to add some functionality (current plan is to focus primarily on Protocol-Error) to RADIUS servers (FreeRADIUS, radsecproxy, Radiator)

### Multipath Traffic Engineering (MPTE)

- **Champions**

    - Kireeti Kompella (kireeti.ietf@gmail.com)
    - Vishnu Pavan Beeram (vbeeram@juniper.net)

- **Project Info**
Multipath Traffic Engineering (MPTE) is a traffic engineering (TE) paradigm that combines TE with Equal/Unequal-Cost Multipath (ECMP/UCMP) load-balancing. The notions of MPTE and of an MPTE Directed Acyclic Graph (MPTED) tunnel are introduced in [draft-kompella-teas-mpte].  An MPTED tunnel is a Traffic Engineering (TE) construct that contains a constrained set of paths representing an optimized Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from one or more ingresses to one or more egresses.  The paths that make up an MPTED tunnel traverse a set of junction nodes, and the state associated with the MPTED at each junction node constitutes a set of previous-hops and a set of next-hops over which traffic is load-balanced in a weighted fashion.  Provisioning an MPTED tunnel in a TE network using a signaling protocol involves provisioning control and forwarding plane state at each junction node. An MPTED tunnel may be realized over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) forwarding plane or a native Internet Protocol (IP) v4/v6 forwarding plane using an appropriate tunnel type.  Depending on the deployment needs, a centralized or a distributed approach MAY be adopted for provisioning an MPTED tunnel.

	- Hackathon Goals:
    	- Evaluate the unique characteristics of MPTED tunnels (multiple ingresses, multiple egresses, largely pinned DAG shape, handling resource failures and congestion events)
    	- Evaluate the requirements of the signaling protocol.
    	- Evaluate RSVP signaling procedures and sequences in detail.
    	- Evaluate PCEP signaling procedures.
    	- Evaluate MPTED data model for managing MPTED tunnels and junctions (config/state).
    	- Evaluate different tunnel types (traditional/shared MPLS forwarding plane, Native v4/v6)

- **Project(s)**  
  - This project presents an integrated framework for automated security management in 5G edge networks using the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) architecture.
  - The proposed system leverages Intent-Based Networking (IBN) to allow users or administrators to declare high-level security intents, which are translated into enforceable network and application policies. Network-level policies are delivered to 5G core components via the Network Exposure Function (NEF), while application-level policies are enforced directly on a User Equipment (UE) through distributed IBN Controllers.
  - This architecture supports adaptive, context-aware, and distributed policy enforcement, enabling real-time response to dynamic edge conditions and user mobility scenarios such as handovers.

### PacketScope: eBPF-based Protocol Stack Analysis and Defense

* **Champions**
    * Zhaoxi Li (li-zx24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)

* **Project Info**
    PacketScope is a general-purpose protocol stack analysis and debugging tool based on eBPF. It integrates performance optimization, anomaly diagnosis, and security defense to provide fine-grained tracing and intelligent analysis of network packets at the protocol stack level. The project aims to solve common pain points such as difficult diagnosis of performance bottlenecks, unclear packet transmission paths, and hard-to-detect low-level protocol attacks (e.g., at layers below traditional WAF/IDS).

    The tool consists of three main microservice modules:
    1.  **Analyzer:** Provides multidimensional statistics on packet movement (latency, packet loss, etc.) and visualizes cross-layer data flow.
    2.  **Tracer:** Maps network routes and latency from the host to any global IP, visualizing the data on a global topology.
    3.  **Guarder:** Filters and controls abnormal packets using customizable rules and leverages an intelligent engine (LLM) to provide context for potential threats.

* **Hackathon Goals**
    * Deploy PacketScope in the IETF hackathon network testbed to monitor and analyze live traffic.
    * Evaluate and enhance the `Guarder` module's rule-based engine for detecting and mitigating low-level protocol attacks and anomalies.
    * Test the `Analyzer` module's ability to identify performance bottlenecks and trace packet paths within complex network topologies.
    * Explore potential integrations between PacketScope's eBPF-based telemetry and other network management or security tools.
    * Develop and test new eBPF probes for tracing interactions with specific protocols being discussed at the IETF.
    * Gather feedback on the tool's usability and visualization for network operators and security engineers.

- **Project Info**
This hackathon topic continues our evaluation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) DNSSEC. The original specification for MTL mode provided support for SLH-DSA underlying signatures. The latest version 08 of draft-harvey-cfrg-mtl-mode updates the hash function constructions and underlying signature bindings to also add support for ML-DSA.  This update was based on community feedback and a desire to offer better crypto agility when using MTL mode. This hackathon will look at:
	1.	Test interoperability between open-source resolvers with both algorithms.
	2.	Look at the performance for each algorithm relative to the other when leveraging MTL Mode.

 This project will demonstrate how existing IETF YANG Models and related instance data can be quickly converted into a Knowledge Graph. By using Semnatic Web Technologies, these models and data can easily be intergrated or extened with external ontologies to enhance the information present and allow graph queries across the data to find deep insights.
 
Specifically it will show how the draft SIMAP YANG model can be represented in RDFS and how it can be integrated with an external wider Ontology (represented by NORIA-O).
