## Airport Transportation 

Brisbane Airport (BNE) is the primary international airport serving Brisbane and South East Queensland. 

[Airport Transportation options](https://www.bne.com.au/passenger/to-and-from/transport-options)

### Fare estimate

An Airtrain ticket purchased online in advance is $21.90 round-trip, which is MUCH cheaper than a taxi or uber.

Passengers can expect to pay $45 - $55 for a taxi or uber (one way for a trip from the airport to Brisbane City). Outside of peak periods, it is approximately a 20 minute drive from the airport to the city. 

### Train :monorail:

The Airtrain is a quick and easy option for getting to and from the airport. Travelling between the Brisbane Airport and Brisbane City takes just 20 minutes. Airtrain travels express to the Gold Coast, linking to the G:link tram for travel to Surfers Paradise and the Gold Coast beaches.

Train services run every 15 minutes during peak times and every 30 minutes off-peak periods. Airtrain also connects into the Queensland Rail suburban network.

If one books a "Return" ticket online in advance, then the return journey on Airtrain is free.  Cost of doing this **online in advance** between *BNE Airport* and the *South Brisbane* station is A$21.90, which is substantially lower than the estimated Taxi cost.

[To book travel on the Airtrain](https://www.airtrain.com.au/)

#### Finding the Airtrain Station 

* At the International Terminal: take the travellator or lift to Level 3 of the Terminal building and follow the signs to the station.
* From the Domestic Terminal: make your way out to the front of the building and take the Skywalk across to the station.

### Rideshare and Uber :car:

Booking a rideshare service? Easy!  Brisbane Airport was one of the first airports in Australia to enable rideshare pick up services, including Uber, Didi, Ola and Sheba. 

Simply order your rideshare using your preferred app and follow the signs to the designated Rideshare Booking areas to meet with your driver.

### Shuttle Bus :bus:

**Door to Door Shuttle Bus: Con-x-ion**

If you’re looking for a door to door transfer to and from Brisbane Airport, consider using the Con-x-ion shuttle bus transfer service.

# Local Guide

(many of the locations in this section are in a [list at google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VHd8eEwtCZcKgvvW6))

## Brisbane Travel Options
### Bus, Ferry and Trains in Brisbane and South East Queensland

South East Queensland has a single integrated ticketing system for all forms of public transport *bus, train, ferry: not hire-car, taxi or uber*, which [covers the region](https://translink.widen.net/s/5wfnjq8tkx/230109-seq-fare-zone) -including Brisbane, North to Noosa and south to Coolangatta.

Most forms of public transport included in this system will require use of a [Go Card](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card) which can be obtained from railway stations with a ticket office, or a [range of retailers](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card/locations). Travel requires check-on and check-off, with transfer between bus, train and ferry possible within a time limit.

Some buses accept cash, but others are go-card only. Bus boarding is by any entrance unless otherwise indicated. Buses typically require flagging down to stop. 

High speed ["citycat" and cross river "kittycat"](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services) ferries are included in this ticketing system. Ferries operate [between U.Q St Lucia and Northshore Hamilton](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services/citycat-and-ferry-terminal-locations) with multiple stops in the city.

### Bike and Scooter hire

Brisbane permits use of e-bikes and scooters, with both [Neuron](https://www.rideneuron.com/) and [Beam](https://www.ridebeam.com/au) available. Use of these bikes and scooters is covered by the [BCC and Queensland Road Rules](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/outdoor-activities/riding-in-brisbane/cycling-rules-signs-and-safety-tips) and require use of a helmet which should be provided with the device. Scooters and Bikes can be speed limited by geofencing in some locations. 

## Slang
 
 Please do not believe reddit and other sources of "what is normal slang" because you will cause great offence using the c-word which is often portrayed as normal, everyday Australian slang. It isn't.
 
 There is a lot of [australian slang](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/living-in-australia/aussie-slang). Use varies, with some common and some uncommon. Swearing is common (see above)
 
 Some people refer to the city centre as the Central Business District or *CBD* and you may see this in maps or local guides. 
 
 We really do say g'day. Use of the word "mate" is highly contextual and may be friendly or not, depending.

## Food and drink in the IETF meeting area

The IETF119 venue is close to a wide array of food and drink choices. The [Southbank parklands](https://eatsouthbank.com.au/eat-and-drink/) has a good guide to choices in the immediate area. These include riverside eating, as well as [Little Stanley Street](https://eatsouthbank.com.au/dining-guide/?precincts=little-stanley-street) close to the meeting Hotel.

### BYO, Bottle Shops and "Hotels"

Bring Your Own (Bottle) - *BYO* or *BYOB* on signs, or websites about a cafe or restaurant means an unlicenced restaurant or cafe permits you to bring your own wine and beer. Otherwise, It may be possible to bring wine and pay corkage (high!), but it is unusual to bring wine to a licenced food venue. Check first.

Carry-Out Alcohol is bought from "a bottle shop" or *Bottle-O* which is typically licenced in association with a Bar or Hotel. Chains include B.W.S. and Dan Murphys

Speaking of "Hotel" although in strict terms this means a provider of short stay accommodation, with the exception of hotel chains like the Hyatt or Marriott, to all intents and purposes "hotel" to a brisbane local means a Bar or Pub (Public House), if a pub/hotel has accommodation in Brisbane it is usually not the principle activity.

In country Queensland, it usually (but not always) does actually provide accommodation. 

TL;DR "hotel" probably means pub, unless it doesn't


### Tipping culture: "it depends"

Australia has one of the worlds best [Minimum Wage](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/tools-and-resources/fact-sheets/minimum-workplace-entitlements/minimum-wages) award systems and all food and drink service staff are paid at or above this level.  Weekend and public holiday work can earn a supplement and may therefore have a noted extra charge.

Tipping is not mandatory, and does not form part of the normal renumeration for serving or cooking staff. Tipping counter staff at shops is highly unusual. 

For exceptional service in a restaurant or cafe it is not unusual to tip. Increasing use of paywave methods includes the proffer of a tip at 10%, 15% or 20% but this can be (and very frequently is) skipped. 

If you see a tip jar its a signal cash tipping is preferred, but this is entirely voluntary and you won't be chased out of the place if you ignore it: a lot of the time for card payment the service staff will click through the tip screens anyway.

High end venues or large group venue bookings may assume or require a tip and should say so a the time of booking.

 ## Emergencies & personal safety
 
 In an emergency dial 000. 
 
 ### Street people and locals
 
West end and south Brisbane provide support services to rough sleepers, the unemployed, and Aboriginal visitors to town from rural and remote locations. Support services are located close to the IETF119 venue and you may see people in distress, or with complex conditions related to alcohol and drug abuse. Generally maintaining situational awareness especially after dark, and unfortunately especially for single women is necessary throughout Brisbane.

### Be sun smart
 
Brisbane is at 23° South and sub-tropical (the tropic of Capricorn is 600km north of Brisbane) -You can suffer significant skin damage from Sun exposure even in March, and on a cloudy day you can still burn if outside for extended periods of time. Use SPF50+ sunscreen, wear a hat, or carry an Umbrella. [Sun Smart](https://www.sunsmart.com.au/)

 ## Wild Animals
 
It's fine. As for slang, don't believe everything you read on Reddit. You are not at significant danger from Australian wild animals of any kind.

That said, we do have Redback Spiders, whose bite is extremely painful for adults and dangerous for small children, fire ants (painful singular, dangerous in volume) And there are snakes in the city, rarely venomous but none the less best avoided. 

If you maintain situational awareness, it is very unlikely you will encounter an animal in Brisbane seeking to cause you harm. 
 
 Fruit Bats can carry lyssavirus, a relative of rabies. (we do not have rabies in Australia) as well as cause Hendra Virus (transmission through horses) -They are safe at a distance, they do not attack, but you should avoid handling if you find one. They roost up river, and fly down past South Bank parklands at twilight and dawn. It's worth seeing.
 
 Parkland may have Possums: Ringtail, and Bushtail possums (it's obvious from the name which is which: Ringtail are smaller) which are mostly nocturnal and entirely harmless. There are many Sacred Ibis ("the Bin chicken") Cockatoos, Galahs, Kookaburra, and other birds. The Australian Magpie and Butcher Birds have beautiful song, but can swoop on passers by in nesting season but are otherwise harmless. Kookaburra are opportunistic food thieves as well as raucus. If you are lucky you may see Silver Eye and Blue Fairy Wren. Bush Stone Curlews stand motionless in a belief like dinosaurs you can't see them if they don't move. If you get too close they will spread their wings to make themselves look bigger. Their cry at night is unmistakable. A small bird in mobs which chases off larger ones is a Noisy Miner, a native species. The Indian Mynah is unrelated and an invasive species. Willy wagtails get their name from the dance. Swans in Australia are mostly black.
 
There are Sacred Kingfishers, Osprey and Bhraminy Kite feeding on the river along with several species of heron and darters, which does contain Bull Sharks (the only species commonly in both fresh and salt water) as well as a range of bait fish and larger species.
 
 We have a couple of species of larger lizard including the water dragon which will be found in the Riverside parklands, (up to 1/2m long). They will make an angry display and hiss if you get close as will Blue Tongues, flatter placid lizards with .. a blue tongue.
 
 Koalas do live outside of the reserves in the suburbs of Brisbane. They're at risk almost all the time you can see them, and an increasingly marginal population declared endangered in 2022.
 
 Wombats are shy, and uncommon close to Brisbane.
 
 There are feral deer, and small marsupials in the larger parklands on the edge of the city (Like Mt Coot Tha and Daisy Hill Reserve)
 
Moreton Bay has a population of Turtles, Dugong (smaller than but related to the Manatee) and Bottlenose Dolphin. In season (June-October) there are Humpback whales. All year round you can see Manta Rays and several species of shark
