## Brisbane Travel Options
### Bus, Ferry and Trains in Brisbane and South East Queensland

South East Queensland has a single integrated ticketing system for all forms of public transport *bus, train, ferry: not hire-car, taxi or uber*, which [covers the region](https://translink.widen.net/s/5wfnjq8tkx/230109-seq-fare-zone) -including Brisbane, North to Noosa and south to Coolangatta.

Most forms of public transport included in this system will require use of a [Go Card](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card) which can be obtained from railway stations with a ticket office, or a [range of retailers](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card/locations). Travel requires check-on and check-off, with transfer between bus, train and ferry possible within a time limit.

Some buses accept cash, but others are go-card only. Bus boarding is by any entrance unless otherwise indicated. Buses typically require flagging down to stop. 

High speed ["citycat" and cross river "kittycat"](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services) ferries are included in this ticketing system. Ferries operate [between U.Q St Lucia and Northshore Hamilton](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services/citycat-and-ferry-terminal-locations) with multiple stops in the city.

### Bike and Scooter hire

Brisbane permits use of e-bikes and scooters, with both [Neuron](https://www.rideneuron.com/) and [Beam](https://www.ridebeam.com/au) available. Use of these bikes and scooters is covered by the [BCC and Queensland Road Rules](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/outdoor-activities/riding-in-brisbane/cycling-rules-signs-and-safety-tips) and require use of a helmet which should be provided with the device. Scooters and Bikes can be speed limited by geofencing in some locations.

## Food and drink in the IETF meeting area

The IETF119 venue is close to a wide array of food and drink choices. The [Southbank parklands](https://eatsouthbank.com.au/eat-and-drink/) has a good guide to choices in the immediate area. These include riverside eating, as well as [Little Stanley Street](https://eatsouthbank.com.au/dining-guide/?precincts=little-stanley-street) close to the meeting Hotel.

### BYO, Bottle Shops and "Hotels"

Bring Your Own (Bottle) - *BYO* or *BYOB* on signs, or websites about a cafe or restaurant means an unlicenced restaurant or cafe permits you to bring your own wine and beer. Otherwise, It may be possible to bring wine and pay corkage, but it is unusual to bring wine to a licenced food venue.

Carry-Out Alcohol is bought from "a bottle shop" or *Bottle-O* which is typically licenced in association with a Bar or Hotel. Chains include B.W.S. and Dan Murphys

Speaking of "Hotel" although in strict terms this means a provider of short stay accommodation, with the exception of real Hotels, to all intents and purposes means a Bar or Pub (Public House), if a pub/hotel has accommodation in Brisbane it is usually not the principle activity. In country Queensland, it usually (but not always) does actually provide accommodation.


### Tipping culture: "it depends"

Australia has one of the worlds best [Minimum Wage](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/tools-and-resources/fact-sheets/minimum-workplace-entitlements/minimum-wages) award systems and all food and drink service staff are paid at or above this level.  Weekend and public holiday work can earn a supplement and may therefore have a noted extra charge.

Tipping is not mandatory, and does not form part of the normal renumeration for serving or cooking staff. Tipping counter staff at shops is highly unusual. 

For exceptional service in a restaurant or cafe it is not unusual to tip. Increasing use of paywave methods includes the proffer of a tip at 10%, 15% or 20% but this can be (and very frequently is) skipped. If you see a tip jar its a signal cash tipping is preferred, but this is entirely voluntary and you won't be chased out of the place if you ignore it: a lot of the time for card payment the service staff will click through the tip screens anyway.

High end venues or large group venue bookings may assume or require a tip.

## Things to do in Brisbane

## About the Aboriginal Community of Brisbane

[West End](https://www.weekendnotes.com/keeping-west-end-weird/) is the precinct adjacent to South Brisbane, where IETF119 is being held. This is one of the more significant Aboriginal community hubs of the inner city. Community housing, health and employment initiatives exist throughout West End to service this community, and the Aboriginal communities of Queensland at large who often come into the city for a mixture of health and socio-economic reasons.

The [Aboriginal communities of Brisbane have a rich history](https://mappingbrisbanehistory.com.au/brisbane-history-essays/brisbane-southside-history/first-australians-and-original-landscape/indigenous-sites/)

[Musgrave Park](https://mappingbrisbanehistory.com.au/history-location/musgrave-park-aboriginal-meeting-place-79/) behind the IETF119 Venue remains a culturally significant meeting place for the local Aboriginal community. [Murri Radio](https://triplea.org.au/) operates FM services locally. the [Aboriginal Flag Intersection](https://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/southeast/huge-aboriginal-flag-painted-on-the-road-at-major-intersection-at-west-end/news-story/e7a93483f9cb5c16faac1af1c7e383fd) [(Google Maps)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/faZUZ7C26YeKrCyS8) remains despite local council opposition and is periodically repainted.

 ## Emergencies & personal safety
 
 In an emergency dial 000. 
 
 ### on Slang
 
 Please do not believe reddit and other sources of "what is normal slang" because you will cause great offence using the c-word which is often portrayed as normal, everyday Australian slang. It isn't.
 
 There is a lot of [australian slang](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/living-in-australia/aussie-slang). Use varies, with some common and some uncommon. 
 
 Some people refer to the city centre as the Central Business District or *CBD* and you may see this in maps or local guides. 
 
 We really do say g'day.
 
 ### Street people and locals
 
West end and south Brisbane provide support services to rough sleepers, the unemployed, and Aboriginal visitors to town from rural and remote locations. Support services are located close to the IETF119 venue and you may see people in distress, or with complex conditions related to alcohol and drug abuse. Generally maintaining situational awareness especially after dark, and unfortunately especially for single women is necessary throughout Brisbane.

The local Aboriginal community frequently gathers in Musgrave Park, and public spaces in West End. Please be respectful of their personal space.

 ### Be sun smart
 
Brisbane is at 23° South and sub-tropical (the tropic of Capricorn is 600km north of Brisbane) -You can suffer significant skin damage from Sun exposure even in March, and on a cloudy day you can still burn if outside for extended periods of time. Use SPF50+ sunscreen, wear a hat, or carry an Umbrella.

[Sun Smart](https://www.sunsmart.com.au/)

 ### Medical
 
 For non emergency situations the nearest hospital is [The Mater Hospital](https://www.mater.org.au/health/hospitals/mater-hospital-brisbane) which is a [Short Walk from the IETF venue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9g99h3aiYWBHPmtHA) and includes the Childrens Hospital, and both public and private emergency services.
 
 * [Queensland Health](...) recommend 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) to check in with trained medical staff
 * [Mater Hospital Public Emergency Department](https://www.mater.org.au/health/services/emergency-care/emergency-care-public) is the nearest public hospital. Wait times are variable subject to triage but often long.
 * [Mater Hospital Private Emergency Department](https://www.mater.org.au/health/services/emergency-care/emergency-care-private) is also available for fee.
 
 Overseas visitors to Australia can be liable for the costs of treatment and [you are advised by the Australian Government](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/health/adequate-health-insurance) to ensure you have either a reciprocal agreement in place for your home economy and Australia, or have arranged health insurance.

 * [Queensland Government guidance on Sexual and other Assault and help](https://www.qld.gov.au/community/getting-support-health-social-issue/support-victims-abuse/sexual-abuse-assault/sexual-abuse-assault-getting-help)
 
 ### Wild Animals
 
 It's fine. As for slang, don't believe everything you read on Reddit. That said, we do have Redback Spiders, whose bite is extremely painful for adults and dangerous for small children, fire ants (painful singular, dangerous in volume) And there are snakes in the city, rarely venomous but none the less best avoided. If you maintain situational awareness, it is very unlikely you will encounter an animal in Brisbane seeking to cause you harm. 
 
 Fruit Bats can carry lyssavirus, a relative of rabies. (we do not have rabies in Australia) as well as cause Hendra Virus (transmission through horses) -They are safe at a distance, they do not attack, but you should avoid handling if you find one. 
 
 Parkland may have Possums: Ringtail, and Bushtail possums (it's obvious from the name which is which: Ringtail are smaller) which are mostly nocturnal and entirely harmless. There are many Sacred Ibis ("the Bin chicken") Cockatoos, Galahs, Kookaburra, and other birds. The Australian Magpie and Butcher Birds can swoop on passers by in nesting season but are otherwise harmless. Kookaburra are opportunistic food thieves. If you are lucky you may see Silver Eye, Blue Fairy Wren, There are Osprey and Bhraminy Kite feeding on the river, which does contain Bull Sharks (the only species commonly in both fresh and salt water) as well as a range of bait fish and larger species.
 
 We have a couple of species of larger lizard including the water dragon which will be found in the Riverside parklands, (up to 1/2m long). They will make an angry display and hiss if you get close as will Blue Tongues, flatter placid lizards with .. a blue tongue.
 
 Koalas do live outside of the reserves in the suburbs of Brisbane. They're in danger almost all the time you can see them.
 
 There are feral deer, and small marsupials in the larger parklands on the edge of the city (Like Mt Coot Tha and Daisy Hill Reserve)
