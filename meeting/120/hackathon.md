## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule)
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org is used for Hackathon presentations and contains repositories for some Hackathon projects.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
    * IETF Hackathon teams should upload their Hackathon project presentations to [GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf120-project-presentations).
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, see details in the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf120-project-presentations/blob/main/README.md)
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before Hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

### <a id="Thread"></a>Low-Power Wireless IPv6 Networking with Thread *
- **Champion**
Stuart Cheshire &lt;cheshire@apple.com&gt;

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a brief presentation about Thread at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/).
For this Hackathon event, the goal is to introduce people to Thread and OpenThread programming. This Hackathon event is open to all — Thread Group membership is not required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate. If you plan to participate in the Thread work at the Hackathon (on-site or remotely), please add your name to the participant list. If you already have a Thread developer board and the OpenThread build environment on your laptop, please bring that. If not, we will have a few extra Thread developer boards available and we can help you get the build environment set up. We will have experienced OpenThread developers present to help people get started.
Below is a partial list of project ideas. Other ideas are welcome and encouraged. Please feel free to add suggestions to the project list.

- **Project Info**

  - **SSH daemon for OpenThread.** Historically the way engineers interact with Thread developer boards has been by physically plugging them into a computer’s USB port and using a serial port console program to access OpenThread’s command-line interface. Now that OpenThread includes TCP support (contributed by [Sam Kumar](https://www.samkumar.org/)) it becomes feasible to access the same command-line interface over the network using ssh. The goal of this project is to identify a compact implementation of ssh suitable for constrained embedded devices, and integrate that into OpenThread. Particularly for testbeds with hundreds of Thread devices, being able to log in and transfer log files using the network is much better than needing hundreds of USB cables to connect all the devices to a computer.

  - **Native Thread Commissioning for Matter.** Current [Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) devices that operate over Thread incur the cost of Bluetooh hardware and firmware, which is only needed for initial commissioning. This adds hardware cost to Matter devices for something that most users only do once in the lifetime of the product. It would be better to perform Matter commissioning for Thread devices via the Thread radio itself, using the Thread MeshCoP (Mesh Commissioning Protocol) mechanism. Some minor work is needed to implement tunnelling the Matter commissioning data (e.g., Device Attestation) over Thread MeshCoP.

  - **Lightweight QUIC for OpenThread.** Both TCP and QUIC are sophisticated transport protocols, suitable for efficiently transporting small and large amounts of data. Zero-round-trip connection setup in both TCP and QUIC allows for small request/response exchanges in a single round-trip. Sliding-window flow control and refined congestion-control algorithms enable TCP and QUIC to transfer large amounts of data, quickly, reliably, and efficiently, without unreasonably disrupting other traffic sharing the network. OpenThread includes TCP, and it would be good to complement that with support for QUIC as well.

  - **General OTA (over-the-air) Firmware Update.** Today firmware is typically installed into the flash memory of a Thread developer board via a USB port. It would be very helpful to have a general way of updating firmware over IP — particularly for people working with hundreds of Thread devices instead of just two or three.

  - **Sensor Data Batched Upload.** Many types of sensors, like temperature sensors, collect data at regular intervals, which should be uploaded to a data collection server in a reasonably timely manner when the Thread mesh is idle enough that such uploads will not disrupt other operations. Now that OpenThread has TCP, it would be useful to have a general mechanism for uploading this kind of sensor data.

  - **Live Thread Diagnostics.** When a large Thread mesh is not behaving as expected, it would be very useful to have a general mechanism for fetching information from nodes on the mesh regarding their connectivity to neighbors and other similar diagnostic data.

  - **Thread Network Optimization Assistant.** Create a Thread network visualizer (or enhance an existing one) to analyze the current network state, identify inefficiencies, and provide prioritized, actionable recommendations for network optimization (e.g., node placement, router selection).

  - **Thread Network Merge Visualization Tool.** Develop a visualization tool to analyze and evaluate the feasibility of merging two or more Thread mesh networks by comparing their topologies, performance metrics, and service landscapes.

  - **Thread Latency Investigations.** One of the main uses of Thread is for home automation, and when you are using an IP network to turn lights on and off, quick response times (under ¼ second) are very desirable. At the same time, an IP network like Thread is ideal for installing firmware updates and similar large data transfers. Because Thread is a low-power low-throughput technology aimed at low-cost devices that can run for years on a single battery, intelligent queue management (including ECN and L4S) is vital so that the network can support large bulk transfers while still maintaining good responsiveness for control operations. The Thread 1.3 specification includes requirements for delay-aware queue management, and there are many research opportunities related to analyzing this behavior and perhaps finding ways to make it even better.

  - **Thread Credential Sharing.** Wi-Fi generally utilizes a user-visible password (when we’re not using 802.1X certificates), but Thread opts instead for strong cryptographic keys, which are arguably more secure, but harder for humans to deal with. When we want to have multiple Thread devices participate in a single Thread mesh, they all need to know the key to the mesh. Work is underway on developing a safe secure way to perform device-to-device key transfer, and this Hackathon will be a good opportunity for the people working on that to get together and do some interop testing and debugging.

### QUIC profiling for Deep Space
- **Champions**
Marc Blanchet, marc.blanchet@viagenie.ca
- **Project Info**
[IP can be used in deep space networking](https://deepspaceip.github.io) with some profiling, especially  for QUIC. Work has progressed a lot in the recent months on which QUIC configuration parameters are needed for this use case. We used the Quinn QUIC stack (see [QUIC in space](https://github.com/marcblanchet/quic-in-space) and [QUIC workbench](https://github.com/aochagavia/quinn-workbench)) since pretty much all necessary configuration parameters were already available in the API. This hackathon is about externalizing the needed configuration parameters of other QUIC stacks in order to be usable in deep space. Depending on the participants interests, we will choose at the beginning which ones we want to modify and create PRs. Feel free to contact the organizers in advance for questions.

  - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9129/
  
- **Project Info**
  - The goal is to demonstrate how operators can use the IETF Topology Yang models to represent a real carrier IP/MPLS network. 
  - We start with one particular problem space: How to use IETF topology model to represent a real carrier network based on IS-IS and OSPF domains for planning/simulation purposes. 
  - We want to demonstrate if RFC8345 is the suitable standard for representing the multi-layered topology for Digital Map and show the models comparison with and without the identified gaps.
  - This IETF120 Hackathon will initially focus on generic topology queries, and compare IS-IS topology and OSPF topology drafts with RFC8345 versus RFC8345bis (gaps identified in RFC8345) approaches. 
  - We would also show how we can retrieve performance metrics or configuration attributes (defined in RFC9030 or RFC9129 and retrieved via device API) northbound from the Controller via RFC8345 API and its IS-IS and OSPF Augmentation. 
  - The next IETF121 Hackathon will start looking at simulation/emulation details.

- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fregly-dnsop-slh-dsa-mtl-dnssec/
- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-harvey-cfrg-mtl-mode/
- **Project Info**
This hackathon will allow participants to experiment with a DNS zone signed with SLH-DSA-MTL signatures as defined in the draft "Stateless Hash-Based Signatures in Merkle Tree Ladder Mode (SLH-DSA-MTL) for DNSSEC". The draft defines an implementation of draft "Merkle Tree Ladder (MTL) Mode Signatures". Merkle Tree Ladder (MTL Mode) provides a mode of operation that can reduce the size and processing impact of Post-Quantum Cryptographic signature algorithms. In this hackathon, participants can interact with two of the authors of the MTL Mode draft to explore the characteristics of MTL Mode relative to DNS resolver and authoritative name-server implementation.  The example signed zone [from the SLH-DSA-MTL draft] will serve as a basis for explaining signing, verification and resolution processes related to SLH-DSA-MTL signatures in the DNSSEC use case.

- **Project Info**
Purpose is to make use of PQ in real world X.509 structures like keys, signatures, certificates and protocols. This will allow us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage in the real world.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

At IETF 120, we plan to setup and test the use of hybrid certificates for the TLSv1.3 protocol. The goal of the experiment is to explore different options for efficient use of hybrid certificates' and their multiple signature keys in the TLS protocol. We are looking for collaborations and ideas that can be then brought forward within the IETF and other standardization bodies (e.g., X9, ISO, etc.).

- **Specifications**
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sheth-dns-integration/

- **Project Info**
Domain names have long been used as identifiers in applications ranging from TELNET and FTP to email services to web browsing.  Recently, blockchain applications, decentralized protocols, and social media platforms have also emerged as new use cases for DNS domain names.  How a DNS domain name is enabled for use as an identifier in each of these applications is known as a DNS integration.

  
 - At this hackathon you will learn and discuss

    -   responsible DNS integration and why it is important.
    -   published measurement studies on responsible DNS integrations.
    -   recently published - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sheth-dns-integration/ on the motivations of using DNS domain names in new applications and the challenges of achieving a responsible DNS integration.
    -   the criteria that constitute a responsible DNS integration. What are we missing?
    -   two application developers integrating DNS domains and their lessons learnt.
    -   any feedback before adoption by a working group?

We welcome anyone interested about the draft to stop by and chat with available authors from Bluesky, Ethereum Name Service, and Verisign who are working on responsible DNS integrations.

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on IPv6.

### Collecting Consolidated ABNF From RFCs
- **Champions**
Dominique Hazael-Massieux dom@w3.org
- **Project Info**
  - https://github.com/dontcallmedom/rfcref/tree/main/abnf

ABNF is used in many RFCs to describe the formal syntax of the associated specification. These ABNF declarations can be used to generate parsers, build tests, validators, documentation …. In a number of cases, the ABNF in a given RFC makes references to ABNF terms defined in other RFCs. The GitHub project above offers tooling to help consolidate these ABNFs into directly comprehensive versions. During the hackathon, interested participants could help extract and consolidate ABNF from more RFCs, explore how these consolidated RFCs could be exploited, approaches to automate more of the extraction/consolidation steps.

This project is inspired by the [webref](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/rfcref/tree/main/abnf) project where a number of reusable data and formal syntax from Web specifications get automatically extracted and curated, which have found adoption in a number of places (documentation, libraries, code/IDE support, automated testing of implementations, spec authoring tools, …)

**Champions**
- Bryan Newbold <bryan@blueskyweb.xyz> (arriving Saturday afternoon, all day Sunday)
- Boris Mann Boris Mann <boris@bmannconsulting.com>
- Chad Kohalyk <chad@fission.codes>

**Project Info**

atproto is an open federated social web protocol. The identity and auth system builds on open standards like DNS, DIDs (W3C), HTTP, and OAuth. The challenges of using OAuth between multiple independent hosts and multiple independent client software implementations are similar to challenges with ActivityPub, and an area of work at the IETF. This hackathon project involves prototyping and demonstrating interoperation between different types of clients and hosts.

- **Project Info**
  - https://github.com/zhangjiaxingict/sconepro-rtc
  - The goal of this project is to study the optimization of RTC application latency through feedback mechanisms. We have developed a simple RTC implementation based on QUIC that generates video frames according to the calculated sending rate and the size of packets in the sender's queue. We have also provided a basic feedback mechanism on network devices. The feedback implementation will be further refined in the future.
  - The project utilizes Docker to simulate AP network devices, as well as the sender and receiver. We use Linux tc to emulate latency and dynamically changing bandwidth at the AP point.
