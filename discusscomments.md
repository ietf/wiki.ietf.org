# Tips for Authors on Getting Through IESG Review (obsolete)
Authors trying to publish documents in the IETF have a tough job to do.  Their documents are expected to take into consideration many different aspects of Internet engineering, ranging from transport to security to manageability.  The major purpose of the IETF review process is to ensure that all of these aspects are addressed.

Obviously, the IETF process works most smoothly when authors take all these considerations into account as they're writing the document.  It's not pleasant to have to rewrite an entire document to address a security issue, especially after months of working group process.  If authors can be made aware of the high-level points they need to address, however, they can be proactive in ensuring that they address the questions that are likely to arise during the IETF review process.

The purpose of this document is to collect the top questions that reviewers from each area ask about a protocol, in order to help authors think about how to answer these questions (and hopefully include the answers in their documents!).  This list is clearly not comprehensive, but it should allow authors to make a good first pass.  In addition, contact points are provided in case authors have questions in a given area.
