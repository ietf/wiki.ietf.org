{.is-warning}

**NOTE: Not all groups maintain pages on `wiki.ietf.org`** 

The URLs for wiki pages of specific groups, if they exist, generally follow the pattern of `https://wiki.ietf.org/group/FOO` where `FOO` is the abbreviation for that group. E.g. the Wiki page for the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is: https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iesg/

Wiki pages for any particular group are linked from the "About" tab on their IETF Datatracker page. For example the IESG wiki page is linked from: https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/iesg/about/

The links below are provided as assistance to find wiki pages for particular groups but are not intended to be comprehensive.

# Working Groups
The IETF divides its work into a number of Areas, each comprised of Working Groups (WGs) that relate to that Area's focus. A list of all active working groups can be found on the IETF Datatracker. 

## [Applications and Real Time](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#ART)  (ART)
The ART Area works on the application layer and related protocols:
+ Real-time applications: These are protocols that enable interactive human-to-human communication (see RFC 3550). Groups in this category are working on things such as real-time web communications, teleconferencing, emergency services communication, internet telephony, and instant messaging.
+ Traditional applications. - These are the protocols we've generally thought of in relation to the application layer. They include such things as email, calendaring, directory services, provisioning and access protocols related to DNS and IP and support for constrained environments. 
+ Application building blocks. These are designed to be used with a variety of more specific applications. They include compression, codecs, internationalization; JSON, XML, and CBOR; media types; URNs; and URI schemes.

## [General Area](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#GEN) (GEN)
The General Area consists of a few IETF WGs and other activities focused on supporting, updating and maintaining the IETF standards development process. As General AD, the IETF Chair manages the General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) and other IETF-wide directorates.

## [Internet Area](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#INT) (INT)
The primary technical topics covered by the Internet Area include IP layer (both IPv4 and IPv6), implications of IPv4 address depletion, co-existence between the IP versions, DNS, DHCP, host and router configuration, mobility, multihoming, identifier-locator separation, VPNs and pseudowires along with related MPLS issues, and various link layer technologies. The Internet Area is also responsible for specifying how IP will run over new link layer protocols.

## [Operations and Management Area](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#OPS) (OPS)
The primary technical areas covered by the Operations & Management (OPS) Area include: Network Management, AAA, and various operational issues facing the Internet such as DNS operations, IPv6 operations, operational security and Routing operations. Unlike most IETF areas, the Operations & Management area is logically divided into two separate functions: Network Management and Operations. The Network Management function covers Internet management and AAA, and the related protocols, including but not limited to NETCONF, SNMP, RADIUS, Diameter, and CAPWAP, and of data modeling and data modeling languages used in management such as SMI and YANG. Another important role of the Management function is to identify potential or actual management issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues. The Operations function is largely responsible for soliciting operator feedback and input regarding IETF work. Another important role of the Operations function is to identify potential or actual operational issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues. The OPS area intersects most often with the Routing, Internet and Security areas.

## [Routing Area](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#RTG) (RTG)
The Routing Area is responsible for facilitating the operation of the Internet routing system by maintaining and improving the scalability and stability characteristics of the existing routing protocols and developing new protocols, extensions, and bug fixes. Forwarding methods (such as destination-based unicast and multicast forwarding, MPLS, and pseudowire) as well as associated routing and signaling protocols (such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, RSVP-TE, LDP, PIM, RPL, and VPNs at Layer 2 and Layer 3), and both centralized and distributed routing architectures (to address, for example, virtualization, service chaining, traffic engineering, and data center routing) are within the scope of the Routing Area. The interactions of routing systems with configuration and orchestration platforms (for example, routing-related YANG models and path computation engines) are handled in the Routing Area as well. The Routing Area also works on Generalized MPLS used in the control plane of optical networks, and the security and manageability aspects of the routing system. The Routing Area Working Groups cover a wide range of data plane technologies (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3) and control protocols. The Routing Area intersects most frequently with the Internet Area, the Operations and Management Area, and the Security Area. Interaction with the Internet Area concentrates mainly on IP forwarding and encapsulation. Ongoing work with the Operations and Management Area is on developing YANG models and considering the management and operation of the routing infrastructure. With the Security Area, the ongoing focus is on routing protocol security and its impact on the Internet's infrastructure security. Work in the Routing Area often overlaps with work in other standards development organizations (SDOs). In particular, there have been interactions with Broadband Forum, IEEE, and ITU-T.

## [Security Area](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#SEC) (SEC)
The Security Area is the home for working groups focused on security protocols. They provide one or more of the security services: integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and access control. Since many of the security mechanisms needed to provide these security services employ cryptography, key management is also vital. The Security Area intersects with all other IETF Areas, and the participants are frequently involved with activities in the working groups from other areas. This involvement focuses upon practical application of Security Area protocols and technologies to the protocols of other Areas.

## [Web and Internet Transport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/#WIT) (WIT)
The Web and Internet Transport (WIT) area covers protocols that provide the functions of the Transport Layer of the Internet, such as QUIC, TCP, UDP, SCTP, and DCCP, including congestion control and queue management. It also has responsibility for protocols that implement the World Wide Web (like HTTP) and adjacent technologies.

# Other groups

## Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [Research Groups](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/)
The IRTF is comprised of a number of focused and long-term Research Groups. These groups work on topics related to Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology. Research Groups have the stable long-term membership needed to promote the development of research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues. Participation is by individual contributors, rather than by representatives of organizations.

## Internet Architecture Board [(IAB) Groups](https://datatracker.ietf.org/program/)
IAB Technical Programs & Administrative Support Groups are structured approaches managed & maintained by the IAB in order to support the IAB in more effectively executing its chartered responsibilities & its architectural oversight role (see RFC2850 ยง2.1)

## [Directorates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/dir/)
IETF Directorates, comprised of experienced IETF participants, often serve as advisory groups for IETF work.

## [IETF Administration LLC](/group/llc/)
This contains information about projects undertaken by the IETF Administration LLC.
